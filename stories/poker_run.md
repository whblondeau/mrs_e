## Poker Run

Dry country sounds different than most places where people go. Especially on hot days; and, well, this was New Mexico in summertime. There&apos;s a kind of sound in the air: the sound of small stirrings of wind, the sound of redbrown rock baking in the daytime sun. Not really a sound you can hear; more of a background noise floor, a small pressure on the ear, with a big hot silence looming over it, empty and still. Only the occasional tick or ping from the cooling motorcycles broke it, and the creak from Izzy&apos;s leathers as he shifted. Boy didn&apos;t know how to hold still, but she didn&apos;t blame him much. It was just damned hot.

Not the hottest part of the state - _that would be down near Alamogordo,_ Mrs. E reckoned - but the Tucumcari area is always hot enough in summertime. It can go weeks, maybe months, without rain in a bad year, and this was a bad year. The dryland plants were shrinking down and thinning out, hunkering patiently against the age-old cycle. As the plants dwindled, the bones of the desert were showing through.

Overhead the sky was a darker kind of blue than Mrs. E was accustomed to seeing. She spotted a couple of buzzards up there, pretty high up. _Not looking for us, not yet,_ she thought with a smirk.

The silence was starting to get to her, so she dug out her pack of American Spirits, put one in her mouth, and sparked the Ronson. The startling rasp of the flint echoed out into the still heat like a mattock sinking through soil and hitting a rock. She drew in a grateful lungful, let it drift away in the surreptitiously moving air.

"That&apos;s gonna help."

"Yeah, Izzy, I believe it will." She took another contented drag.

"I told you, my name&apos;s Isaiah."

"And I told you not to be a whiny little bitch about my smoking, so I guess we&apos;re even." It wasn&apos;t her first time babysitting a new kid on a Mine House run, but Izzy was particularly annoying. Well, somebody had to keep him alive.

Mrs. E took a long drink from her canteen, sloshed it. A little less than half full. "How&apos;s your water supply?" Izzy wore racing leathers and a full-coverage helmet, and he probably wasn&apos;t going to be careful about dehydration.

"I&apos;ve still got some Gatorade." Mrs. E made a face but didn&apos;t say anything. He had a point, and she was glad he was taking the dry country seriously enough in that respect. The power of suggestion worked, too: He pulled the bottle out and looked at it, then took a long swallow. "How much longer are we going to stand here in the g - in the damn sun?"
