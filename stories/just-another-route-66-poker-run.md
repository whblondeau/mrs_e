###Just Another Route 66 Poker Run

####The Big T

Dry country sounds different than most places where people go. Especially on hot days; and, well, this was New Mexico in summertime. There's a kind of sound in the air: the sound of small stirrings of wind, the sound of redbrown rock and dirt baking in the daytime sun. Not really a sound you can hear; more of a background noise floor, a small pressure on the ear, with a big hot silence looming over it, empty and still. Only the occasional tick or ping from the cooling motorcycles broke it, and the creak from Izzy's leathers as he shifted. Boy didn't know how to hold still, but she didn't blame him much. It was just damned hot.

Not the hottest part of the state—_that would be down near Alamogordo,_ Mrs. E reckoned—but the Tucumcari area is always hot enough in summertime. It can go weeks without rain in a bad year, and this was a bad year. The dryland plants were shrinking down and thinning out, hunkering patiently against the age-old cycle. As the plants dwindled, the bones of the mountain were showing through. Tucumcari Mountain isn’t really a mountain. It’s more of a two-mesa layer cake. They were up on the top of the lower mesa, north of of the upper mesa, and the air was a little cooler there; but they didn’t have any shade.

_Near the Big T_ had been the rendezvous description, and Tucumcari Mountain’s Big T wasn’t too far away. It looked like a scatter of weird white rocks, this close to, but from the distance it resolved into the hillside letter “T” that Tucumcari’s civic pride kept whitewashed.  The local kids did it, apparently, had been doing that for years. They probably didn’t have the least damn idea that when they renewed the T they were taking part in a powerful ritual of Aptitude.

Overhead the sky was a darker kind of blue than Mrs. E was accustomed to seeing. She spotted a couple of buzzards up there, pretty high up. _Not looking for us, not yet,_ she thought with a smirk.

The silence was starting to get to her, so she dug out her pack of American Spirits, put one in her mouth, and sparked the Ronson. The startling rasp of the flint echoed out into the still heat like a mattock sinking through soil and hitting a rock. She drew in a grateful lungful, let it drift away in the surreptitiously moving air.

"That's gonna help."

"Yeah, Izzy, I believe it will." She took another contented drag.

"I told you, my name's Isaiah."

"And I told you not to be a whiny little bitch about my smoking, so I guess we're even." It wasn't her first time babysitting a greenhorn on a Route 66 run, but Izzy was particularly annoying. Well, somebody had to keep him alive.

Mrs. E took a long drink from her canteen, sloshed it. A little less than half full. "How's your water supply?" Izzy wore racing leathers and a full-coverage helmet, and he probably wasn't going to be careful about dehydration.

"I've still got some Gatorade." Mrs. E made a face but didn't say anything. He had a point, and she was glad he was taking the dry country seriously enough in that respect. The power of suggestion worked, too: He pulled the bottle out and looked at it, then took a long swallow. "How much longer are we going to stand here in the g—in the damn sun?"

“We made good time. The Dealer probably won’t make it for another hour or so. Still, the sooner we’re out of here the better.” The American Spirit was really a pleasure.

“Look… I know I’m not supposed to say anything, but smoking is really bad for you.”

She gave him a flat look. “Your point here?”

“Those things are going to kill you. Unless you crash and that do-rag somehow fails to protect your skull from impact.”

Mrs. E laughed. In her head, Esmeralda laughed too, a creaking sort of whispery laugh. _My motorcycle is weird,_ Mrs. E thought.

_“You wouldn’t ride me if I wasn’t.”_

_Weren’t_. Once an English teacher, always an English teacher.

“Izzy, you don’t get it. I might die soon, yes. Maybe on this trip; maybe you’ll have to deal with my dead body. But seriously, it’s my life… besides, I care more about keeping _you_ from dying.” _You earnest, pious fuckwit._ 

“Well, if you die, you won’t exactly be able to even do that much, will you?” 

“Touché. But try not to worry about it. I’ve been riding for a long time, and Esmeralda won’t crash.” She dropped the butt and mashed it beneath her boot.

Izzy shook his head, scratching his nails through his brown curls where the sweat was itching. His full-coverage helmet wasn’t exactly comfortable in hot country. Mrs. E wore a do-rag for lots of reasons, not the least of which was a stubborn sense of personal style; but it sure felt better than any helmet she’d ever tried on. Especially in the heat. “Sometimes I think you think that she’s—it’s—a horse, not a motorcycle,” he said. “And then sometimes I think you just have an imaginary friend.”

_“If you only knew, kid,”_ said Esmeralda in her laryngitis-girl voice.

Izzy looked at their bikes. The machines could hardly have been more different. He rode a Suzuki GSXR 600 crotch rocket that exasperated Mrs. E: a hunched high-tension monster, weird-ass science fiction special effects styling including an obnoxious burnt-orange tank and fairing; to her, the thing hardly looked like a motorcycle at all. 

Esmeralda, by contrast, was a bobbed 1949 Harley Panhead, painted black everywhere: low-slung, spare, rakish. Rebuilt to be violently fast for a Harley, with style to spare, there was still no way that she could have gone nearly as fast as Izzy’s bike. But…

Back in the beginning, when Izzy, chafing in dumb testosterone resentment over his junior role in the Poker Run, had unwound on the freeway in Illinois, he had been shocked to see Mrs. E keeping up with him without apparent effort. She had let him run for a while, then signaled a slowdown when Esmeralda had expressed a little concern over the Suzuki’s ability to run redlined for so long. He had obeyed the signal (probably also worried about what the high-speed run was doing to his bike), and they had had a long cooldown ride. 

Whey they’d finally stopped for a break, Izzy had refused to look at Mrs. E for a long time. Then he’d only said, “I don’t know what you had done to that bike. That just shouldn't be physically possible.” 

“More things than are dreamt of in your mechanical engineering,” was all she’d said.

That was the beginning of Izzy’s rough education in the realities of the Poker Run community. He had shown distinct signs of strain, especially when they’d gotten their third card, a Jack of Clubs, in Meramec caverns. The Dealer was something in the dark that was, beyond denial, simply not human. Mrs. E had kept a close eye on Izzy for a while after that: she had known too many (non-D&D-playing) engineers to be confident of his mental resilience. But he’d gotten over it, or at least decided to live with it provisionally. She thought he might do all right after all. With careful minding.

Now they were at the cryptically-designated Big T, waiting on a Dealer—_story of my life_—with a middling hand: three Tens, Ace of Hearts, Six of Spades. This would be another discard deal, and they had to make it count. Three of a kind is pretty good in normal poker, but Route 66 Poker Run rules allowed as many discard-and-draw deals as the team could make within the time limit. They still had till sundown in two days; but it would be hard to get to many more Dealers and still get to Santa Monica by then. 

Then, too, she was tired, and Izzy was tired. Mrs. E thought that some of the other teams didn’t need much sleep.

It was not quite an hour later when they spotted the pickup truck. Green, somewhat rusty, working its way up to the Mountain.

“Think that’s him?” said Izzy.

“Unless it's someone who’s going to bust us for trespassing.” Mrs. E really didn’t think it would be that. She was good at sensing cops and patrols, and Esmeralda was better. Still, she kept wanting to stick a needle in Izzy. He was getting better, she admitted. He didn’t tense up. Much.

They needn't have worried. It wasn’t any sort of law. To all appearances fully human and, to Mrs. E’s satisfaction, "he" turned out to be female. A sort of Western cowgirl archetype, in denim pearl-buttoned shirt and worn jeans and even more worn boots and an ancient stained cowboy hat. Masses of dark hair, tanned skin with maybe some Native blood, crow's feet at the corners of her eyes. “You the folks wanting a Dealer?”

“We are,” said Mrs. E. “Glad you could make it.”

“Sorry about the wait. I had to drive up here from Tucson.”

Esmeralda cackled and started singing in her dry whispery voice,

_“I've been warped by the rain_<br/> 
 _Driven by the snow_<br/>
_I'm drunk and dirty, don't you know…”_

_Knock it off, Esmeralda._ “Not a problem. Need a drink?”

The Dealer shook her head. “Plenty in the truck, thanks.”

“Then we won’t keep you. Izzy’s got the deck.”

He handed their deck to the Dealer. She opened the box (which neither of them could do) and looked at Mrs. E, who was looking at their hand in fierce concentration.

“Gimme two.” She handed the Ace and Six to the Dealer, who pocketed them, and who then dealt fairly off of the top. She closed the box and returned it to Izzy. 

“I'll be along then. Good luck.” With a friendly wave, the Dealer climbed into her pickup, circled, and jolted off down the Mountain.

“How are we doing,” asked Izzy when his eyes had stopped following the woman.

“Haven't looked yet,” said Mrs. E quietly. Izzy moved closer, stood next to her.

The cards up: Ten of Spades, Ten of Diamonds, Ten of Hearts. She turned the first dealt card: Three of Diamonds. Not good. She turned the second dealt card.

Ten of Clubs.

“…Well now,” said Mrs. E. “I think I’m going to buy you dinner.”

“Hope it’s close by.”

“We’re going to Del’s. It's in town, another 66 landmark. And don’t even fucking tell me that you don't like Mexican food.” 


#### Not far from Kingman

Immense cirrus brooms swept the sunset west, burning, pierced with contrails, looking like God was a redhead and She had shoved chopsticks in Her hair, the messy way that certain redheads can get away with, and if you say anything they just unbutton a top button and look at you some more. The roadhouse up ahead under that ragged display of sky had to be the place: Sharon’s Bar and Grill.
 
The clue had been “Don’t keep the Deal to yourself.” Mrs E snorted. Sometimes the Route 66 Poker Run community was overly cute.

Anyway, they needed food and a rest, and it was getting time to gas up the bikes. The Deal in Flagstaff had lost them a lot of time, and hadn’t paid off all that well: they’d upgraded their kicker card from three of diamonds to six of hearts. Now they really should push on. Mrs. E hoped that the Dealer at Sharon’s would not be hard to find, and wouldn’t make them wait.

They motored into the dirt and gravel parking lot and eased themselves off of the bikes. Esmeralda was quietly humming a little wandering song that Mrs. E couldn’t place.
 
Sharon’s was a pretty typical Western place: a low frame pole building, not a lot of neon, lamplight shining out of the windows over the railed front walk in the darkening evening. A few pickups and 4-wheelers in the parking lot, a smattering of other vehicles. Not exactly a jumping night.

They pushed through the doors. “Table?” asked Izzy.

“Ordinarily. But tonight I want to sit where we can talk to those underutilized bartenders.”

They hoisted their road-weary asses onto barstools. Izzy was carrying his helmet, which she thought was kind of dumb, but at least it helped identify them. Not very many of the customers scattered round the tables bothered to look at them much.

The bartender, a lean kindly-faced woman with a fall of iron-gray hair, ambled down to their end of the bar. “Evenin’. Can I get you folks anything?”

“Got anything from Pearl Street Brewery?” asked Izzy.

The bartender smiled a bit. “They don’t deliver down here, as it happens.”

“Uh, OK… what was that brewery in Flagstaff?”

The bartender wasn’t busy, and she seemed to enjoy rambling conversations about breweries, so Mrs. E let it ride without trying to bust things up. Eventually Izzy settled on a nut brown ale that the bartender thought he’d like. “And you?”

Mrs. E smiled a little. “Lone Star. And a big glass of water. We’ve been on the bikes all day. And menus.” The bartender dropped a small wink and moved off.

“So,” Izzy said, “How many more Deals can we make before we need to get to the end?”

Mrs. E had been thinking about it. “Maybe two more, if this one doesn’t slow us down as much as the last one did.”

“Is it really that important? We’ve got four of a kind already.”

“Which is pretty good, in a normal game of poker. But we’re playing against some tough customers who move fast. And the kicker card matters…”

“…because everybody’s got their own deck.” He grinned. Nice grin. Kid wasn’t exactly handsome, but he could crinkle the corners of his eyes just as if he were. “I’m not as dumb as I come off.”

Their drinks came. The bartender, taking the hint, had brought Izzy a water unasked. Mrs. E took a long swallow. The Lone Star was crackling cold and it felt wonderful going down her throat. “Ah hell, I needed that.”

The bartender grinned. “So, what brings you through these parts?”

“Honeymoon,” Mrs E deadpanned. Izzy choked on his beer, and the bartender smirked appreciatively. “No, it’s a little less likely than that.”

“Poker Run, huh?”

Mrs. E stared at the woman for just a moment, mind blank. “I’m Mrs. E. And this is Izzy.”

“Isaiah,” he corrected.

“Maria.” She shook his extended hand.

“You know about the Poker Runs, do you?” asked Mrs. E.

“Sure. They’ve been through here time and again. Route 66.” She skipped a deliberate beat. “People with a lot of Aptitude.” She nodded at Izzy. “Like him. And sometimes the ones you can’t place. Like you.” Izzy was gaping. Mrs. E felt like doing the same thing, but she had her, well, poker face on.

Aptitude was something she had known how to recognize for a long time. Thing was, Maria clearly had no trace of it. She could be a lifelong orienteer with a Vincent Black Shadow parked in front of her house, who worked the Times of London crossword every day, and the Poker Run Committee wouldn’t give her the time of day.

She wouldn’t even be able to find the Committee to talk to them. Even Izzy had managed to do that himself, without help.

So how had she—

Suddenly there was a growing roll of thunder from outside. Not a storm of the air, but a storm of engines. Mrs. E knew it instantly. Big cruiser motorcycles were rumbling into Sharon’s parking lot, and stopping. She counted them off as they shut off.

Esmeralda’s voice, thinned to a distant whisper, reached her mental hearing. Just barely. _“This isn’t good, Honey, not good at all…”_

Izzy was blinking and frowning uneasily. “What are—”

Mrs. E held up a finger, wait. Seven, eight—nine?… “Nine or ten bikes. And take it from me, these are not your basic Minnesota Shriners on Gold Wings.” She looked flatly at Maria. “Might be trouble. Do you get outlaws in here much?”

Maria twisted her mouth sideways a bit. “Some. Never had much of a problem with ‘em. They’re not as bad as people say, long as you give ‘em some respect.”

Mrs. E nodded. “I always got along with the Diablos pretty well, and I wouldn’t expect trouble with the Angels…”

“Wait - _Hell’s_ Angels? That’s what you mean by ‘outlaw’?”

“Yeah, Izzy, but the HA’s aren’t usually a problem, not for civilians anyway. They just don’t have much to prove. There are other clubs though, and some of them… Some of them, especially the associate clubs, have a lot to prove. Like Republican politicians or guys with tiny dicks who buy big trucks. Gotta be more extreme to get noticed.

“And sometimes people are just fucking evil, and there are clubs where lots of evil assholes coagulate.” She sighed. “But one thing I can tell you about just about every outlaw club on the planet?

“They’re gonna seriously disrespect a Suzuki crotch rocket.”

Izzy turned pale and sat for a moment, then stood up reluctantly. Mrs. E stood up too. “Besides, Esmeralda’s not happy. I needed a smoke anyway. Let’s go see what they’re up to. Hopefully having a smoke themselves.”

“Who’s Esmeralda?” Maria wanted to know.

“Tell you later. We’ll be back in to order dinner.”


<br/>
The bikers outside were having a smoke, yes. But they were not normal outlaws. Nothing even close.

The bikes were almost reasonable, but they weren’t at all the kind of thing an outlaw club would ride. Intensely stylish machines, not Harleys or any model she really knew. Each one customized to a sort of restrained gothic look: heavy fantasies in black and chrome, huge square engines with radiators on the front. She’d never seen anything tricked out to look so convincingly vampiric; most goth bikes ended up looking like they were designed by eighth-grade stoners, but these were solid, brutal, organic bikes with lines that breathed speed. Like Ed Roth had risen from the grave and turned his hand to designing bikes for a Halloween rally.

The riders, though, the riders were… just fucking strange.

First of all, they had full-coverage helmets, which outlaws never use. Black, rakish helmets, with visors that jutted down shadowing their faces. Some of them had left the helmets with the big bikes; but they were all wearing black hoodies, and the ones who had taken their helmets off had flipped the hoods up over their heads, shadowing their faces almost like medieval monks. The effect was spooky and menacing, not monastic.

_“Religious orders are spooky and menacing too, dear.”_

Mrs. E looked for the club insignia. Every outlaw club wears a sleeveless vest over everything else, the “colors”, with conventional artwork and legends proudly sewn or embroidered on the back. These bikers had vests of black denim all right, but the insignia was unusually simplistic: a single stylized red eye, glaring. She looked back at the bikes and saw a similar device on the side of every gas tank.

_You have got to be fucking kidding me._ Black mounts, Black garb, shadowed faces… and the Red Eye.

Nine Riders.

Which wasn’t as silly as might have been the case if they were just ordinary geeks on bikes. They were not. Each of the Riders she focused her attention on had Aptitude. As much as Izzy, some of them. A few probably had more, of she was any judge.  But bad. Bad stuff. Underlying heartbeats that she could hear, nine of them. Nine hearts pumping fear and horror instead of blood, nine hearts far gone in terrible loneliness and loss. She wanted to run away, to swing a leg over Esmeralda and go, abandoning everyone and everything. Not even with any hope of getting away—Esmeralda was insanely fast, but the Riders’ bikes looked like they could keep up—just _run_.

Perhaps the most frightening thing was that they were adapting themes right out of Tolkien—nothing from Peter Jackson’s stupid fucking movies.  That kind of discipline and thinking meant they were dangerous: channeling Aptitude depended on powerful, intelligent use of the deep imagination. Aptitude conditioned on cheap tropes didn’t have much of a bite…

_“Yeah, that’s what they are, all right,”_ said Esmeralda, sounding shaken. _“What… Are they trying to do the Poker Run?”_

“Tough customers who move fast, and cheat,” Mrs. E said grimly, almost managing to speak normally over a hollow lack of breath. “These are not Poker Run players,” she continued for both Izzy and Esmeralda’s benefit. “These Nazgûl, these Black Riders, are henchmen. Somebody sent them.”

“Why are they here?” Izzy spoke with quiet attention.

“They might be here to take us out,” said Mrs. E. “Poker Run’s a dangerous business. People have killed to eliminate players with strong hands before, although it’s damned difficult to know who’s got what. Still, like any card game, there’s usually some way to cheat… But they don’t even have to kill us. Just damage the bikes. If they start making a move in that direction, I’m intervening.”

“How can you do that?” asked Izzy reasonably. “There are nine of them; they’ve got Aptitude set up to fulfill one of the more frightening archetypes of modern literature.”

“We’re armed,” she reminded him. Or did you…”

“Yeah. My Glock is with the bike.”

Mrs. E was silent for a moment. “Don’t ever do that again.”

“I won’t.”

“Well… I’ve got six bullets in my revolver. That’s a few short even if I shoot better than I’ve ever done in my life. And it’s hard to shoot well when Aptitude’s working against you. And I have to admit, I don’t want to kill anybody, even someone who might want to kill me.”

“‘Might?’”

“Yeah, ‘might’. Maybe they’re not here to kill us at all.”

_“Fuck else would they be here for?”_ Esmeralda whispered, sounding miserable.

“Maybe they want to kill the Dealer.”

“It’s kind of discouraging when you say things like that,” said Izzy after a moment. “All right. I don’t know much about Aptitude except that I have a lot of it. Can I—”

_“Nono don’t.”_

“Esmeralda says No. I say ot only No, but Fuck No. It’s not just that they’d kill you. They could probably control your Aptitude and use it against us… Look, right now getting that Glock is the biggest thing we need to worry about. Esmeralda, can you tell if the Nazgûl are armed?”

_“…Knives, but no guns or grenades or anything,”_ she said after a minute.

“Esmeralda says no guns. Knives only. So here’s what we do. I will go and engage them, get their attention. You time it as best you can, walk—<i>walk</i>, you hear me? Don’t hustle, be cool—over to your bike, unlock the side panel, get your gun. Make sure it’s loaded and the safety is off. The safety is _off_, all right?”

“I’m an engineer. I get that.”

“You’re an engineer who left his fucking gun in the lockup on his bike. You don’t have a combat-type mind. Violence starts, you try to keep your shit together, be methodical, and don’t shoot anybody except the Nazgul. Don’t wait, just start. One at a time. Don’t shoot fast; take time to fucking aim. One. At. A. Time.” Mrs. E realized that she was terrified, which always made her repeat herself; but that was probably right for Izzy. Anyway, she seemed to be in control of herself. “Fucking Poker Runs, why do I even do this shit? More backstabbing than a Faculty Committee.”

_Esmeralda, tell me if something starts to happen._

“All right, Izzy. Showtime. And? If something happens to your bike, get Esmeralda the fuck out of here.”

_“Not without you! I won’t start!”_

_I need you to get the fuck out if something goes wrong. Do it for me, Esmeralda, if it’s got to be done, just please do it._

Mrs. E fished an American Spirit out of her pocket, and walked over to where the Black Riders were smoking. Somebody, she figured, ought to have a light.


#### Violent people doing things wrong in a parking lot

“You don’t need a light,” the Black Rider said.

“I’m asking anyway.”

The few Riders standing near Mrs. E were listening casually, smoking themselves. One of them had a long-stemmed pipe that she felt was a ridiculous affectation, but that still somehow presented a sense of menace and apprehension. Fear, and a grinding sense of presence, rolled off of them in waves. It smelled faintly like dead bodies, and sounded like distant swooping wings.

The Black Riders were good. What would, in members of any other motorcycle club, be a simple matter of casually burning one out in the parking lot, became in their hands a strange and powerful ritual of Aptitude. Smoke wreathed about in trails and rings; hooded and helmeted heads nodded slightly in unison, as if to an unheard chant. No face was to be seen. They were just _big_—large men, stooping forms with powerful shoulders. They always seemed, out of the corner of your eye, to be reaching out with those long arms. Their colors vests all included embroidered patches, with one common patch showing to her glance: a skull and crescent moon, with, she was amused to notice, “MORGUL ORIGINAL” written below it in black letter.

“I’m asking for only a little thing. The gift of fire, if you like.” She gestured with the American Spirit.

They recoiled slightly, and Mrs. E gave the shadow of a smile. “‘These riders do not love it’ - I think that’s the written form.”

The biggest of them stirred a little, his leather belt and boots creaking, his helmet filled with empty dark. “But I think you would not find it to be your friend in the wilderness.” There was a shade of amusement in his harsh thin voice. He had a unique patch on his vest, a patch that looked like a playing card. Then she realized that, no, it came from a different deck, of course. It looked like an adaptation of the Waite Tarot King of Swords, a menacing robed figure on a throne with a masked or hooded face holding a single sword.

It wasn’t easy to see, but she thought it made an important clue. It was the design choice of someone for whom image was more important than substance: a Ring of Power would be more aptly represented by Pentacles, but the Waite King of Pentacles was a more fussy, thickly drawn picture: hard to turn into such an ominous image.

“How about a light, Witchking?”

He bowed his head slightly. “You have asked thrice. A light then, lady, much as I’d like to refuse you.” His gloved hand dipped into a pocket, came out with some sort of vintage lighter: looked like maybe an old Dunhill, blackened (of course.) He flicked it with a kind of cold courtesy, and she held her cigarette to it. She was almost unable to inhale. It felt like her lungs could neither draw nor breathe out. She managed it though, through sheer force of will. _Maybe this is what black lung is like_, she thought; but it wasn’t much of a joke.

Most of the Black Riders were watching intently. _Good. Izzy can maybe get his fucking gun while they’re looking at me and waiting for my move._ They were surrounded in ponderous, poisonous Aptitude; she had nothing of the kind, and they would be wondering what in the hell she did have. The longer she could keep them in doubt, the better Izzy’s chances would be.

“And now,” said the Witchking after she’d had a satisfying drag, “We should discuss whether this cigarette is to be your last.”

She nodded slightly. _He’s negotiating, not working his way up to immediate assault._ “You’ve been sent here. You’ve been looking for me.”

“And you were hard to find,” he said calmly. “You move very fast.”

“If I’d known you were chasing us, you wouldn’t have caught us at all.”

“Perhaps not,” he conceded. “But we have powers of pursuit and tracking that might surprise you.”

_Why’s he boasting? Maybe he’s not as confident as he wants to sound._

_“He’s very powerful,”_ warned Esmeralda in a faint secret breath, barely there at all. So Esmeralda was taking care not to let the Black Riders hear her. Good to know.

Mrs. E took another drag, drawing the moment out. “Well, you’ve found me now. What do you want?”

“A simple thing. Just give us your deck of cards, and your drawn hand. Only that; then we will leave you in… peace.” He said it like an inevitability, putting forth his power. Mrs. E felt dizzy and sick, and was amazed that she still stood and still presented an unconcerned face. She took another puff, even though she knew in her heart that the Riders would leave her for dead, and she would be buried right here in the parking lot, buried alive with gravel and sand filling her mouth and her unblinking eyes.

“Well,” said Mrs. E after a moment, in a rusty voice, beginning to waver in the face of the horror. “That’s  unprecedented. For the last few decades anyway.” The Route 66 Poker Run Committee had been dealing with cheat schemes ranging from the brutally powerful to the wickedly subtle for a long time. The protective enchantments were immensely strong, refined and tested over the years. She frowned. “I don’t see how I could give those up even if I agreed to. The enchantments bind me, too.”

“We did think of that,” the Witchking agreed, his harsh voice dropping lower with sudden menace.

Mrs. E knew she didn’t have much time. With a surge of strength she forced the gathering spell of doom and defeat away. “Who SENT you? Who was it?” she shouted with a sudden whipcrack in her voice. The Black Riders hunched with tense menace, like alarmed spiders; the Witchking himself seemed startled for a moment.

Then he smoothly pulled out a long thin dagger. Both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward, bearing down on Mrs. E.

<br/>
Izzy, moving placidly, had reached his bike without drawing more than casual interest from a couple of the Riders. Mrs. E had seemingly been equal to the task of holding the attention of Ringwraiths.

He unlocked the box and surreptitiously got the Glock out. It was loaded and there was a spare clip, which he pocketed. Mrs. E had been very specific about unsafing the gun, but she hadn’t known that a Glock doesn’t have a separate safety catch. You either shoot it on purpose or you don’t. He’d been smart enough to say nothing to her about it, because it was beside the point. She wasn't an engineer. She didn’t have to be right.

Mrs. E had done OK, he had the gun, and he was supposed to walk quietly back out. But the bikes were standing there, side by side. They’d be unprotected if he left… He had a sudden irrational sense that Esmeralda was afraid. With an engineer’s curiosity, he listened carefully, with his mind not his ears. Mrs. E, after all, seemed to communicate with Esmeralda. Maybe there was something objective there… Well, not for him. He couldn’t hear anything from his own bike either.

Then there came a brief, faint wash of exasperation. He imagined—if it _was_ imagination—a whispery voice saying _“Your bike doesn’t [something] because [something] think.”_

Izzy, an engineer, should have known better; but, like a person on a bad phone connection, he responded to something he couldn’t hear by being louder: _ESMERALDA, IS THAT YOU?_ he thought, carefully forming the question with strong concentration.

The two nearest Black Riders snapped their faceless heads around, staring right at him.

With a pang of horror at his own mistake, Izzy stepped to the left, opening a space between himself and the bikes, and racked the Glock. Then he raised the gun in proper shooting stance just as he’d been taught, picked the Rider on the right, and started aiming and shooting, deliberately. The loud flat deafening bangs of the gun echoed across the parking lot. Once, twice, three…

And then the Glock quit firing.

The Rider he’d targeted was staggering backwards, gloved hand to his shoulder, turning, stumbling to the gravel. The other Rider had thrown his hand up, a commanding gesture of power. Izzy suddenly realized that Aptitude could make a mechanism malfunction, even a mechanism as reliable as the Glock. He racked it again, squeezed the trigger. _Click_.

The second Rider was stalking swiftly towards him, boots thudding with determination. Izzy, his engineer’s mind functioning coldly and clearly now that he had a mechanical problem to work with, locked the slide back, desperately ejected the magazine, stepped to his right, racked the empty gun quickly once, twice, and then there was no more time as the Black Rider leaped at him, a horrible long pounce, grabbed him, and threw him like a rag doll.

Izzy flew and skidded and rolled and fetched up against his own bike, rocking it but not quite toppling it over. The impact jolted him hard; he had hit his head. The Rider stood over him, drawing a long heavy double-edged knife, really a kind of short sword.

Izzy was suddenly stricken with terror the like of which he had never known. He could scarcely breathe, his heart was thudding, and his mind was blotted out with black thoughts of death. Unreasoning, horrified, he tried to crouch away, and through sheer luck his cringing movement took him just out of the path of the blade’s thrust.

A motorcycle tank is made of sturdy sheet metal, but it’s no match for the bodily strength of a Black Rider and the hardened steel of the blades they use. The keen point punched into the tank and the tip stabbed a little bit out through the other side. Izzy kept scrambling back. The dead howling fear still dominated his mind, and a thundering roar seemed to fill his ears. The Black Rider held the hilt and yanked, but the sword remained trapped, wedged between the sheared edges of metal. He placed a boot on the tank, grasped the hilt with both hands, and gave an angry heave. With a tortured shrill squeal, the blade tore out of the tank. Suddenly overbalanced, the Rider fell on his ass, hissing in anger. The bike tipped and fell on his right boot with a crash—

And the _snap_ of broken bone.

Izzy suddenly felt the crazed fear melt away. His mind cleared. _Of course. The Nazgûl used spells of terror as a weapon. Hmm. Not so good at keeping that going with a broken leg, are you._

The Black Rider shrieked, a shivering inhuman cry of rage like a bird of prey. It stabbed Izzy's eardrums and left him blank and shivering. Then, still pinned, the Rider twisted towards Izzy, and lifted the sword as if to throw it.

Izzy, wanting no more contest with the Rider's horrible physical prowess, staggered back and ducked. But the blade never came. The Rider was suddenly ignoring him, looking away over towards the rest of the Riders.

It suddenly became clear to Izzy that the roaring in his ears was not just a noise in his head. It was sound in the real world, the rumble of more motorcycles. More big powerful shuddering motorcycles. Headlights were swinging in long curves into Sharon’s parking lot, lighting the group of Black Riders that were clustered around something on the ground.

He started running as best he could, unsteady, managing finally to clear the Glock and fish the spare magazine out of his pocket. Mrs. E was down. He had enough shots to take out a lot of the Riders, if he could catch them at unawares; but now there were the new motorcycles thundering in. _Who the fuck is it now? Hell’s Angels for real??_

_“No.”_ Esmeralda’s tiny hoarse voice sounded terrified. _“Not Hell’s Angels. Not Bandidos. Not Mongols. Not Outlaws. Not—”_

_What? You can tell?_

_“I can tell,”_ she said, scarcely to be heard. <i>“It’s </i>them<i>—the people who, the people who…”</i>

And the Black Riders ignored Izzy completely, because the new motorcycles had stopped, the last of their engines rumbling down into silence. A couple of bikes left their headlights on, lighting the scene. The riders dismounted.

“Well now. Looks like you’re mistakenly on our territory.”

The words were not very loud, but they carried in the evening air. The spokesman was a tall, lanky blond guy in denim and boots, who had ridden in on a pretty radical chopper: chrome, brass, metallic paint.

“Who are you?” the biggest of the Black Riders said in a cold, harsh, thin voice. If he had used that voice on Izzy, Izzy would have started shooting and not stopped. The Black Riders were moving, shifting back and forth, and Izzy tasted again the terrible dark fear welling from them. He was too tired and worn down. He slumped to the gravel, shaking.

The blond biker shrugged. “Should have made it your business to know who we might be. I can see without much difficulty who _you_ are, anyway. But you’re some ignorant motherfuckers if you don’t recognize the Exclusive Machinist Services MC. I’m Zed Gursky, President.” The glare of the headlights flooded his granny glasses as he looked from side to side, turning them briefly into blank discs of fire; his face curled into a sadistic grin. “I expect you’re waiting for us to start shaking and shivering and fall down and crawl away? Well, disappointment is a part of life, even the kind of life things like you have. I’ve always wanted to say this:” He leaned forward a little. 

“‘Your Jedi mind tricks will not work on me, boy.’”

The other Exclusives cackled and guffawed. They were a ragged lot, not as big as the Nazgûl, not as elegant and menacing and powerful. But Izzy could tell that they had completely dominated the situation. He couldn’t understand why or how.

“We do not take orders from you,” the lead Black Rider hissed. “We are the Black Riders. We have been killing and commanding since before you were born. We—”

“_You_ are going to shut the fuck up and listen.” Zed’s flat, firm voice cut across what was starting to sound like a fine tirade. “We need you to be gone. We have a prior claim here.

“The old lady on the ground. Is she dead?”

The Black Rider chief drew himself up, and spoke in a deadly tone. “Come not between the Nazgûl and his prey. Else—”

“Roto!” Zed shouted angrily. “That Rider dead?”

“No, he’s alive, Zed,” came a woman’s voice from the direction of the Rider Izzy had shot. “Let me know if you want that fixed.”

Zed was looking over at Esmeralda, and at Izzy’s motorcycle still pinning the other rider’s broken leg. “Fat Fuck, you useless sumbitch, _be careful with that cigarette!_ Jockamo, get the bobber moved now! Before Fat Fuck blows something up.”

“Zed, I was just fuckin with him. He’s all kinda soaked in gas now.” The fat man was one of those whiny people.

Zed shook his head. “Stupid motherfucker thinks he’s gonna get patched some day, but he’s always gotta expostulate,” he said conversationally to the Black Rider leader. “You know what that’s like, right.”

The Witchking started to shake his head, shrugged, gave a grudging nod.

“All right. Get your people together and get the fuck out soonest. Roto and Jockamo and Lon can help you with medical care. I guess your casualties’ll have to ride bitch.”

“What if they can’t?”

“I’ll kill ‘em myself and dump the bodies in the desert. Ain’t nothing that I haven’t done before.” There was a short silence, then Zed smiled that mean smile again. “Those are nice bikes. Triumph Rocket IIIs, right? We’ll take good care of the ones you leave behind. Real good care.” He moved to where Mrs. E was lying on the ground, the Black Riders moving aside for him. “All right, what did you do? She’d better not be dead?”

The Black Rider leader shook his head slowly. “I pierced her heart with a Morgul-knife,” he began intoning.

“—which has to remain in place. All right. We’ve— all right.” He looked at Izzy. “You’re a part of this, right? Then help. You medical? And put that fucking 9mm away. We’re done shooting here.”

Within fifteen minutes the sullen Black Riders were rumbling away into the night, trailing echoes of horror and misery like too-long scarves floating in the wind of their passage. Izzy and Zed had improvised a stretcher for Mrs. E.

Izzy was not, in fact, medical, but fifteen minutes seemed like no time at all for a gunshot victim and a guy with a broken leg.

He also thought Mrs. E looked really bad with a knife in her heart. She was still breathing, long ragged rasps; and there wasn’t as much blood as you’d think; but she looked really bad.

There was a man waiting interestedly on the walk by the door, tall, gray hair and mustache, with a suit and a bolo tie and a cowboy hat and boots. He watched them bringing Mrs. E to the bar.

“I kept everyone inside,” he said calmly, in a gravelly voice. “They wanted to come out and mix it up, but, well. Civilians.”

Zed nodded, preoccupied. Izzy suddenly had a feeling of vertigo. “Uh, you're a cop?” Hoping his voice remained casual. _Because I just shot a guy a while ago, without clear provocation, and you were probably watching out the window…_

The man smiled with big yellowed teeth. “Well, not exactly that,” he said. “I'm a Dealer. Heard tell I was wanted here.”



#### I Put A Spell On You

Mrs. E died on the table, but it wasn’t what it sounds like.

For one thing, it was a pool table. The Exclusives had thrown a sheet onto it and set up a sort of desperate operating theater. The problem was, she was dying already. The Morgul knife had gone in deep, and cut her heart muscle. There was blood everywhere.

Mrs. E was sort of awake, sort of aware, but confused. Her heart was hurting like hell. _Oh, don’t tell me,_ she thought bitterly, _Don’t tell me that after a lifetime of telling doctors to fuck off, I actually did have a heart attack._

She tried to remember, but it wasn’t going well. What had happened? She had been going out to ask a light from the Black Riders, so Izzy could get his gun…

She could hear the Exclusives arguing.

“We _have_ to,” snarled Roto. “We can’t let her die because she’s been stabbed by a Black Rider—it would be the end of her.”

Zed hesitated, then nodded. “Go then.” he spat crisp orders, and the Exclusives moved.

Jimmy got the jukebox stoked, and it started up with a menacing rhythm rumble: Creedence Clearwater’s magisterial cover of “I Put A Spell On You”.

Zed gestured and said something that nobody could follow, and in his hand suddenly materialized a terrible thing. Something between a meat cleaver and a machete, growing like a time-lapse movie of a sprouting plant. It gleamed dully in the lamplight. He stepped to the pool table, and then it fell with a sickening impact, chopping Mrs. E’s arm off at the shoulder.

_“Ain't gonna take none of your foolin' around,”_ roared the jukebox.

She had never thought that anything could be so horribly painful, so shocking. Darkness irised in along the edges of her vision, and she felt her body shaking, as if from a long way off. The pain was bad, but the confusion was worse. She lost any sense of who she was or where she was.

_“Because you're mine”_…

Fogerty vaulted into his incredible solo.

She felt her awareness thin out, fleeing the agony. Her hearing filled with an echoing hiss, which deepened to a shuddering thrum. _Chop shop,_ the words came to her as an insane joke; and she struggled to hold to the idea, for no reason except that there could never be any reason for this. _Dying._

She thought she heard Esmeralda crying out and sobbing, _“No Honey stay with it, don’t lose this”_ but the confusion _the confusion_

Zed swing his cleaver a second time, splintering her collarbone shattering ribs, gashing deeply into her chest, severing her lung from the top down—and neatly obliterating the stab wound the Black Rider had left. He retrieved the Rider’s long thin evil knife, set it carefully aside.

And then she was forced out of her agonized destroyed body, seeing from the perspective of a released spirit, hovering in the space above her own death, seeing Zed, bloodspattered face grimacing bitterly, lifting the cleaver _again_

The thunderous _boom_ of the shotgun wrecked everyone’s hearing.

_So why can I hear the music still?_ It was one of the best guitar solos ever laid down, _ever_, not the worst soundtrack for your own death,

But Zed was lurching forward, falling. Shot, she realized, shot.

Maria behind the bar jacked another round in, _clock-clack_, and nothing grabs your attention like the sound of racking a pump shotgun in combat _indoors_. She was screaming in a strange hoarse voice “That was only rock salt motherfucker rock salt you hear me, next round is double ought _nobody move_”

Fogerty’s guitar launched into the weird build of the solo, swinging and gathering power.

The Dealer was looking at Maria with one eyebrow raised. A man awaiting developments.

Zed was shrieking with no human voice, thrashing. Rock salt burned like hell but there was no way it could be hurting him like that. But there he was, staggering, losing it. Dropping the cleaver to the floor with a dull _thwack clatter_.

_“Don’t leave us yet don’t”_ Esmeralda wailed.

Jockamo the biker dude couldn't have moved so fast, but he did: there he was, suddenly over by the bar, lunging, ripping the shotgun up and out of Maria’s grasp, backfisting her so she bounced off of the wall and dropped into a slumping heap, “Go,” he shouted back over his shoulder.

But Zed wasn’t going to do any more cutting. He was crumpling, transforming into something, starting with the places where the rock salt had hit him. Something like ice. Something like burning embers. But there was no steam, no smoke, no hiss: Zed shriveled and diminished, weirdly like the Wicked Witch of the West, screaming, spilling, burning, the wild light of flame refracted through the glassy ice as his substance consumed itself. Everyone stared in horror.

_‘Vanishing like ice and embers on the floor’. Zelazny got it right,_ she mused in momentary curiosity. Then bitter fury welled up. <i>So they get upset by </i>this</i>, but I’m the one who—</i>

_“That’s my girl. Bitch about it, snarl about it, don’t let go. Rage, rage against—”_

Roto scooped up the cleaver from the floor, and it was like something horrible from a samurai movie. Mrs E watched, from outside her body, as the faded muscular redhead swung and chopped again and again, crunching through bones, hacking muscles and organs apart. And Mrs. E _still felt_ it all. Felt every sensation of being cut to pieces that were thrown aside, meat, guts. Bones breaking and being flensed, bloody strips of flesh falling away.

The guitar screamed up into the ravening climax as Mrs. E died.

She knew she was dead. It was certain knowledge, not to be denied. Besides, to her unendurable relief, the pain faded away. <i>What the fuck. What the </i>fuck<i>. I can still see and hear.</i>

_“Yes, Honey, you’re still here. You’re dead, but you’re here. That’s how it works…”_ Esmeralda whispered through her sobs.

The music swelled over the shocked bar.

_I need to look,_ thought Mrs. E. _I need to see what my body looks like when it’s torn apart. And I need most of all to see my skeleton. My skull._ It was an overwhelming intuition. Learning the great secrets of her own bones was somehow the most important thing she could do.

The biker paramedic mechanics from Exclusive Machinist converged on Mrs. E’s dismembered carcass, moving with the music, making a powerful ritual dance of it, the way Mrs. E remembered. They had done that in the chop shop when Esmeralda was reassembled. Slowly she began to understand, as they used scalpels and knives to clean her bones, even paring the blood off somehow. Sort of a curettage, really.

Mrs. E watched, numb, stunned, fascinated, as they cleaned and rejoined her skeleton. It came back together all right, she thought. In fact, the shapes of the bones were… exquisite. Strong, perfect curves and struts. Organic engineering at its finest. The Exclusive crew was mending the broken and split and splintered places somehow. Mending them back into something graceful and gleaming.

_Damn. It’s been a long time since I thought I was looking good._ She had no head to shake. Whatever she was now, was as disembodied as it gets. _Being dead is weird._

_“It gets better,”_ whispered Esmeralda, frightened but trying to be encouraging. _“You’re gonna be all right. I think.”_

#

Izzy was shaking and gasping, forgotten, over by the bar. The horror of Zed and Roto’s dismemberment of Mrs. E had left him almost incapable of motion. He realized that he was holding the Glock, and that he wasn’t about to use it on anybody. Mrs. E was dead, the crazy Black Riders had been run off, and that Jockamo dude from Exclusive hadn’t even bothered to take his gun away, like he’d taken the shotgun from Maria.

Maria. Jockamo had knocked her out, maybe hurt her badly. Maybe she was dying or dead.

Shoving his pointless gun back into the waistband of his leathers, Izzy moved sluggishly to the bar. _Gotta stop hyperventilating. Gotta stop shaking._ Maria was sprawled on the floor, her long dark gray hair spilled over her face. He clambered up and dropped down, knelt, moved the hair, touched her neck and head gently. He saw she was breathing, and something tight eased inside him, a little.

Breathing, yes, and some blood was leaking from the corner of her mouth. Probably just a cut from that lightning blow the biker had laid on her.

Izzy tried hard to remember all of the first aid he’d ever been taught or read about. And he was a pretty smart guy with a good memory. Maybe he could keep Maria alive…

No major bleeding. Breathing OK. Check for broken spine or neck next.

#

Jimmy had stoked the floor-shaking jukebox with more Creedence Clearwater. It was another ominous one, ambiguous, a slow descending shuffle. "Graveyard Train", that was it, “On the highwayyyyy…” Fogerty growled. Mrs. E laughed silently. _Good jukebox._

The Exclusive people were really grooving with the music and their strange rhythmic dance. They moved aside, looking right at Mrs. E—<i>Well, that’s </i>somebody<i> who can see me.</i> She couldn’t wave hello, not having hands. Not having anything but a point of view. They gestured gracefully, like stage magicians indicating the lady sawn in half who was inexplicably whole.

_“Thirty boxes made of bones,”_ Fogerty sang. _Yeah, thanks…_

But they had plenty of reason to feel proud. Mrs. E drifted closer, somehow, and gazed at her skeleton for a long time. Brilliant, really. _Were these beautiful bones inside me all along?_ she wondered. _Or did these people—these whatever the fuck they are, these demons or spirits or constructs of ice and burning coals, these Exclusives—make my skeleton just… better?_

_“It’s, uh, complicated,”_ said Esmeralda.

Oh yes. They had made Esmeralda a good deal better when they reassembled her.

Suddenly Mrs. E got it, and was hit with a wave of grief. No eyes to cry with. _Oh Esmeralda. Was it like this for you?_

_“It was… pretty bad.”_ Esmeralda sounded worried.

Mrs. E looked right at her own completely fleshless skull. It didn’t seem creepy or spooky. It seemed noble, the seat of awareness and reason. The empty eyesockets—_what had they done with the eyes and brain?_ she wondered absently—were deep and dark. When she looked into them, she saw a faint glimmer of light, like foxfire, or like a distant lantern seen through fog. Curious, she looked more closely; and suddenly, with a rush of vertigo, she realized that what she was being pulled, was slipping into her own dead eyes, into those whirlpools of darkness funneling down and away so far.

She passed into her skull through the left socket. Inside it was a vast dark space streaked with lights. She realized that it was like being in an airplane, flying over distant scattered towns at night.

It was a great strange landscape she flew above, dark bones of earth piled in ridges and peaks, sawtooth sierras and vast plateaus breaking out into fingered mesas, bone-pale stretches of desert, dark immense forests, scattered luminous cities. And above it, hanging like an unimaginable vaulted cathedral, distant starscapes. Nebulae and galaxies, swarms and streams of stars, old ones, young ones… Ancient starlight, light born of iron, seeped down from the tremendous glimmering depths, to silver the landscape’s edges, glitter in threads and tarnished stretches of water.

She felt a sudden strange yearning for it, a powerful drive to go there.

_“Yes,”_ sobbed Esmeralda, <i>“Yes, we can and we will. Those are </i>roads<i>, see them, Honey, roads we can roll on.”</i> The motorcycle’s hoarse young voice throbbed with excitement: she said “roads” in a drawn-out, embarrassingly lustful whisper: _“rooooadsss”_. Mrs. E looked, and with a strange sort of sight glimpsed roads everywhere, winding in the high country, tracking across the desert, switchbacks climbing mesas and mountain passes, lanes in small settlements—even boulevards in cities, but not trafficked much. They sketched and traced and curled over the countryside of her vision, stretching over the landscape. Rooooadsss.

_Where is this, though?_ Mrs. E wondered. _Just a dream, in my head?_ Oh fuck: she had no face and no palm. Yes, literally in her head.

_“No it’s real. It’s… a place we can go now. Well, that we can go as soon as you finish this initiation…”_

Mrs. E suddenly felt herself withdrawing from the immense vision. Her disembodied point of view lifted from the god’s-eye view of the strange great country, watched it dwindle to receding dabs and blurs of foxfire, and passed back up out of her own dark elegant eyesocket, thrown out whirling and tumbling like a bird blown clear of an erupting geyser.

_“This is it, Honey. They’re putting you back together.”_ Esmeralda’s voice was getting even raspier with strain and weariness and a strange worried excitement.

The elegant skeleton was being clothed again in flesh: organs carefully packed into place, nerves and blood vessels plumbed, muscles reattached. The Exclusives moved with grace and wild panache, but they did everything right.

“Hey,” said the old guy, Lon, perpetual cigarette dangling unrepentantly from his lips as he worked over a torn lung, “‘iss one’s fucked up.”

Roto stopped. The freckles showed hard against her pale strained face. _Must be hard,_ Mrs. E thought dispassionately. _Field promotion to Chief Surgeon. Or Mechanic._ Esmeralda ghosted a faint tense laugh.

“What is it, Lon?”

“Fuckin’ cancer in it.” He, and a few of the others, chuckled. <i>Oh </i>Fuck<i> oh no,</i> Mrs. E thought, <i>I hope Izzy didn’t hear that—</i> She turned her bodiless vision in Izzy’s direction; he was getting a bottle of something and crouching back down behind the bar. _Ah. OK._

Esmeralda cackled. _“I'm gonna tell him.”_

_Bitch._

“How bad?” Roto wanted to know.

“Couple tumors, some i’filtra’ve growth.” The skinny mechanic heroically managed to retain his cigarette.

“Can you cut it out?”

Lon shrugged. “Yeah mos’ly. Wa’ me to?”

Roto cursed, a weird echoing imprecation that seemed to roll away into far echoing distances. “…If Zed was still here, I’d give up one of mine. We can’t leave her with just one.”

“Ain’t like you got big tits in the first place.”

“Fat Fuck, you dumbass, _what_ does that have to do with anything?” Roto snapped. Lon was laughing wheezily, working at the lung with some kind of skinny switchblade.

“Just sayin' don’t shrink your ribcage, pretty lady. Use that Morgul blade instead,” explained Fat Fuck patiently, grinning, gesturing pointlessly.

Lon’s head came up, not laughing anymore, looking at the perpetual loser. “Uh?” He took a long drag on his cigarette, staring real hard at nothing; then nodded, dropped the butt, and mashed it with his bootheel. “Gimme that?” he asked Roto.

She nodded too then, picked up the thin knife with a nauseated flinch, handed it carefully to Lon. _Oh hell no, I don’t want that thing anywhere near me._ With the acuity of her disembodied vision, Mrs. E could see some of the horrible things invisibly written on the hilt. But Lon either couldn’t hear her or didn’t care. He picked the thing up and began gently slicing at the sectioned lung, cutting the tumor away with a studied delicacy, a steadiness much at odds with his scraggly appearance.

Mrs. E then realized what was happening. The knife was not just removing the tumors—it was _destroying_ them. Its death-curse was still active. The keenness of her perception showed her, in a kind of symbolic vision, how the curse reached out with slow hideous deliberation, crawling along the webs and fibers of invasive tissue, and expanding out to kill the metastases born of the tumors. Everywhere, in all of Mrs. E’s flesh, scattered or reassembled. _Pretty good death curse._

_“Got to hand it to those Black Riders,” Esmeralda agreed, sounding fascinated._

After a while Lon gently laid the Morgul-knife down on the table, careful not to touch anything else with it. He blew out a long breath, looking desperately weary. “Awright. Lung’s good to go.” He cracked a gap-toothed grin. “Patient’s cancer-free.”

With a subdued cheer, the Exclusives got back to work. Mrs. E saw Roto give Lon a nod. That kind of mechanic-to-mechanic nod. Then she put her hand on Fat Fuck's shoulder for a moment. “Good thinking. You did all right. Zed… Zed would've been proud.”

Mrs. E could hear the ghost of Roto's thought and intention. The woman would have said that Zed would probably have patched Fat Fuck to full membership, but had held herself back at the last moment. She couldn't make any promises, and she couldn't raise false hopes. Mrs. E thought that Roto was going to make a damned fine President.

Roto looked right at Mrs. E's disembodied point of view and shook her head tiredly. “No I'm not.”

Right at that moment Mrs. E started feeling the first twinges of pain. Distant, faint, but menacing, like the sound of a freight train coming miles away, singing in the tracks: you know it's going to be a monster of power and momentum when it arrives, and it just won't stop or slow down.

_Oh fuck. I think I'd rather stay dead._


#### Ball and Chain

As they worked, and Mrs. E watched every piece of herself being put back together, the jukebox rolled into a slow rolling long 8-bar thing, with a brilliant shivering guitar solo setting things up. And just about at the same moment, she realized two things.

First, that this was Joplin’s cover of "Ball and Chain", the 67 Monterey performance.

Second, that the train of pain was smashing into her. She had no skin. No eyes. And her disembodied consciousness was sinking into that body… and it kept hurting more…

_“Honey, you have to hold onto yourself! You have to be you… or you’ll come apart and be gone forever.”_

<i>I </i>can’t<i> do this!</i>

There was a brief silence. Then the motorcycle whispered sadly, _“I did it. And I didn’t have anybody to talk to while it was happening.”_

The worst of it was that, when she was being cut and broken apart, Mrs. E could, and did, escape into death. Being rebuilt and brought to life, there was no escape. It was hours of agony—felt like hours anyway, although objectively it lasted only for a few replays of "Ball and Chain"—of being intensely aware of everything that she was, physically and mentally. All of it hurting with a kind of pain so severe that it almost lost meaning.

She was never sure, afterwards, if she could have done it without Esmeralda prompting her. Wise, clever motorcycle: demanding memories and stories, forcing her to hold her soul in one piece—no, not one piece, but at least a basketload of touchstone fragments, broken glass… she had a sense of Esmeralda idly poking through those memories, like a stoner playing with a dish of tumbled, polished stones, agate and turquoise and citrine and obsidian, driftglass from the sea and strange lovely minerals from deserted mining dumps in Colorado.

They were the memories that had lasted, the ones that made Mrs. E who she was. Smoking her first cigarette while reading _The Hobbit_, in fifth grade. The dirty ecstatic thrill of licking fellow bookworm Monica Hendricks's pussy at twelve. Reading Ginsberg’s _Howl_ at twenty. Hearing Robert Nighthawk playing slide guitar on Maxwell Street. She'd never gotten over that sound. Hell, she'd never gotten over Monica. Nor Ginsberg. Nor Tolkien. Nor pipe-weed of any description.

The shores of Lake Michigan in her high school years, leading inevitably to working her ass off on a Mississippi River tug, down to the Gulf, then the open sea, crewing on a yacht to the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. The Greek Isles…

Esmeralda gave a shocked gasp. <i>“You did </i>not<i> fuck Leonard Cohen!”</i>

<i>I was </i>young<i>, and </i>cute<i>. And the things he said. The man could talk. Every word mattered. I remember conversation more than actual lovemaking.</i>

_“I think you’re just… an unreliable narrator.”_

<i>You’re a </i>Harley<i>. You shouldn’t be so goddamn prim.</i>

Back into the memories, if only to escape the agony. In and out of San Francisco, Summer of Love and all of it. _Never owned a car. My first motorcycle was a 650 Norton. It was because of Hunter Thompson. I heard he had gotten one of those._

_“Mmmm, Nortonnn.”_

…Vignettes, people, magnificent mountainscapes and deserts, remote communes, music… music. Musicians. Townes Van Zandt. Rosie Flores. Coffee with Butch Hancock, desperately trying to remember every word, defeated in part by the weed… Learning crafts, maintaining a motorcycle without much help. Book after book going off like depth charges in her mind. Long stoned conversations about ethics and politics and the underlying realities of history. Sex. Drugs. Drink. Driving much too fast. Rough schooling in what the spy community calls “tradecraft”, just to stay out of trouble—because trouble could always find a bisexual hippie chick with a big motorcycle in the West. Learning to meet threats with words and wit and sincerity—and when those failed, any weapon that came to hand. Never a particularly violent person, but learning to keep her head on straight in a fight even when she was high or tripping, because she couldn’t be free otherwise. Like the man said: _To live outside the law you must be honest._

Marriage to a good guy, breaking up one long sad night on the pier at Algoma. Hearing of his death years later, leaving, ending up in Amsterdam for a long time.

Back to the States eventually, getting a job teaching English, fighting with School Boards and other teachers. Students like meteors streaking across the night sky. Poetry slams.

Finding a 1949 FL Panhead in need of some factory original love…

If proof were needed that not only is there life after death, but that life after death can be good, they used a shot of Casa Noble to revive Mrs. E when they had finished.

The completely implausible jukebox was playing "Delta Momma Blues", and she felt embarrassingly grateful for Townes’s intricate picking over the simple song, when she came to herself again: lying naked on a bloody sheet on a pool table, the taste of tequila in her mouth, with blood _everywhere_.

“Oh, not this again”, she croaked, with the best deadpan she could muster.

“Hey,” said Roto. The other Exclusives grinned and gave small nods.

_“Hey,”_ said Esmeralda.

“Guess you made it.” Roto looked wrung out.

Mrs. E felt pretty good, actually. There was still a lot of pain, but it was a residue, a pale echo, a fading thing. Underneath it was a vitality, a warm flexible feeling. She moved, slowly stretching arms and legs, and then froze.

The morgul-Knife was back in her heart.

Deeper than before: the haft was partly buried in her chest. She felt the cold steel promise of the death-spell piercing her. “The fuck?”

“Careful,” Roto said quickly. “It came too close to killing you. We had to make it part of you.”

“…So now if I bump my chest on something, or roll over in my sleep, the knife punches in the rest of the way and that’s how I die?”

“No”, said Jimmy. “We rebuilt you with a sheath in your heart. It’ll hold the knife all right.”

“Uncle Sigmund is listening, kid.”

He twisted his mouth wryly. “We didn’t have much choice… And you can take the knife out if you need to, to cut something or somebody. Just clean it before you put it back. And don’t lose it, or it will, uh, try to find you again. Don’t know whose hand might be holding it when it does.”

Mrs. E touched the hilt lightly, knowing and hating the evil things written there. “Well. A little more death, a little more crooked timber won’t really matter, I suppose… uh, I _am_ still human? More or less?”

_“Just better than ever. You’re a shaman now. Like me. Only, without wheels.”_

“And, hey, Jimmy. That was your work on the jukebox, right” The kid looked at her, tired but clearly feeling good. Mrs. E glared at him. “Did you absolutely _have to ruin some of my favorite songs?_”

The Exclusives looked at her oddly. “Huh? Those are…” Jimmy looked confused. “You needed power songs as a shaman, so I took what would matter the most. They aren’t _ruined_, they’re what you use now.” He smiled a bit shyly. “I mean really. "I Put A Spell On You"—that’s bad ass.”

“I’m gonna have to get used to that.”

Roto nodded wearily. “Look… let’s get you cleaned up and dressed. We’ve… got a lot to do yet.”



#### Shotgun Maria

Mrs. E looked up and around. The place had completely emptied out, except for the Exclusives, and Izzy, Maria, and the Dealer loitering over by the bar. “Hey, Izzy.” She managed a wave. “How are you liking the honeymoon so far?”

Izzy gave Maria’s arm a squeeze and walked warily over to the table. The Exclusives watched him neutrally. “Are you…”

“Since you’re about to ask the dumbest question possible, let me stop you right there. _No_ I am not OK; but only in the sense that I’m naked and covered in blood and… hungry.” She really was.

The Exclusives had cleaned and mended her clothes along with everything else. Maria got some wet bar towels and handed them to Izzy, not wanting to approach the Exclusives. None of the Exclusives made eye contact with Maria either. _Looks like Zed’s not forgotten._

“All right”, she said when she had dressed, “I really do _have_ to eat. Maria, I’m sorry to ask, but can I get something from the kitchen?”

The waitress nodded. “Everyone’s gone. I’ll have to cook it.”

“I’ll help,” said Izzy.

“I’ll help too,” said the Exclusive biker called Spydog. Maria flinched a little. “Really,” said Spydog. “I used to be a grill man.” He looked at the other Exclusives. “Rest of you want some food?”

“Why did everybody leave?” asked Mrs. E. “And why haven’t the cops come?”

“When things started getting out of hand, I took it upon myself to send them on their way,” the Dealer admitted. “As long as everything’s cleaned up by morning, nobody’s going to remember any of it.”

_“Wow,”_ said Esmeralda. _“I knew Dealers had serious Aptitude, but I didn’t expect this.”_

He smiled. “There weren’t so very many of them.”

Roto rolled her shoulders. “Before we get started with the food, we’ve got some business. What’s your name, shotgun girl?”

“Maria.” She held her silence for a moment. “Look, it was only rock salt, and that guy was cutting Mrs. E into pieces. What the _fuck_ would you have done?”

The Exclusives stood together, and shadows seemed to gather around them. “About the same, I expect,” said Roto. “It was a misunderstanding in an emergency. Besides, no way you could have known that rock salt is lethal to our kind. Tragic—” her voice thinned, caught for a moment. “Look. No hard feelings.”

“Then why—” Maria swallowed. “Why are you looking at me like that?”

“It's not about feeling. It's about consequences. There are consequences here.”

“What kind of consequences?” asked Maria tightly.

“You kill an Exclusive, you need to take his place.”

The bar had gone dead still. The Dealer looked fascinated. Izzy just looked blank. Maria was pale and tight.

“What? You mean, I’ve got to get a motorcycle and ride with you? Because that’s… I can’t afford…”

“That’s how it is. Except for a couple of details. You don’t need to buy a bike: you inherit Zed’s. It's a good one.” She sighed, raked her fingers through her hair. “And you inherit his colors.” She pointed to the crumpled heap of clothing left behind when Zed’s body had vanished. “You’ll notice that those colors are patched ‘President’. That makes you my new boss.”

“Your _boss?_ I don’t know how, and I don’t have time.” Maria sounded desperate. And more than a little pissed off. “And I’m sure as hell not gonna be cutting up old ladies with swords and bringing them back to life. I’m not even like you. If I get shot with rock salt I bleed and scream, I don’t turn into ice and burn away.” She looked at Mrs. E with frightened appeal on her face. “This is crazy.”

“Dunno. There are rules and bindings in things like this,” Mrs. E said. “You might not have a choice.”

Roto shook her head, sad and gloomy. “Not a good idea by my way of thinking either. But I can’t let you off the hook, girl. You killed him, so you pick those colors up and put ‘em on, and we can all have some fucking breakfast.”

Maria looked bewildered. “How many hours a week? What would my responsibilities be?”

“Hours a week.” Roto massaged the bridge of her nose, then burst out laughing. “Fuck, Maria, how many hours are there _in_ a week? The Exclusive is your only life now.”

“168.”

“Thank you, Jimmy. Very much. Look, Maria. You. Pulled. That. Trigger. So just put the goddamn colors on.”

“I have a daughter! She’s only 9!” Maria wailed.

“Well… that sucks for her. She can’t come along.” Roto shook her head. “One person.”

“Does it have to be Maria herself?” asked Izzy.

“Huh? Well, who the hell else? She’s the one that shot him.”

Izzy was smooth. He stepped over to the pile of clothes, grabbed Zed’s patched vest, and shrugged into it. “I need a working bike, as it happens.”

“You can’t quit the Poker Run!” the Dealer shouted. His voice boomed louder than it should have. Fading echoes of the shout rolled around inside Sharon's.

“He can,” said Mrs. E. “I can finish the Run on the team’s behalf. It’s in the Rules.”

“There’s another Rule you’re forgetting,” growled the Dealer.

“Another—” _Oh. Fuck._ She remembered the phrasing. She had thought it mildly funny at the time. ‘Death terminates all contracts of Poker Run participation.’ “But… I’m alive _now_.”

“Not entirely. Not exactly,” he grated. “But that doesn’t matter. The rules don’t say shit about reanimation, or resurrection, or whatever you fucking psychopomps might get up to. You died. You’re out of the Run.”

“We appear to have a problem,” Roto said mildly. “Izzy’s disqualified too. Exclusives are barred from participating in Route 66 Poker Runs. For good and sufficient reason.”

“Granted. About five reasons actually.”

“And he sure can’t take those colors off now.”

“Putting them on was quitting. The penalty for quitting without a surviving teammate—”

“Yeah, I know.” Roto looked at the Dealer with a hard edge of worry. “We don’t have any interest in getting into it with you. Especially with a brand new President. Kind of a handicap.” She shook her head. “Maria’s the better shooter,” she said regretfully. “…No offense, Izzy.”

The Dealer smiled, an evil smile with a lot of teeth. “I’m obligated to enforce the rules.” He started gathering Aptitude around himself: a shimmering around his hands, and a sound like rattlesnakes sliding across a dusty wooden floor in a deserted building. Another sound, unmistakable: shuffling and riffling a deck of cards, over and over. A faint bad smell like dead skulls in the desert sun.

The Exclusives moved into a pattern of power, and called shadows up, thick and clustering. Their eyes started to glisten with fiery orange, kindled like candles. Izzy drew his Glock.

“Hold up,” said Mrs. E. “I think I know something that can stop this. Dealer!”

“Yes, Ma’m?” he drawled lazily, his eyes remote, in his mind already dealing death.

“Those Black Riders. Someone sent them to interfere. There’s a Rule that covers the priority of investigating cheating.”

His eyes grew sharper and more focused. “You got something on them?”

“I should have something on _him_. The one who sent them.”

“Well now.” He pursed his lips. “Well now.”

“I shouted at the Riders, when I realized they were going to attack me. _‘Who sent you?’_ It was sharp and as commanding as I could make it. I wanted to shock them into thinking about the answer to the question.”

“You have powers of voice command sufficient to grab the attention of a Nazgûl?”

“I have twenty-two years teaching high school English.”

“Oh. Well, then.” He looked at her quizzically. “But you hadn’t been through the initiatory dream at that particular point. You couldn’t hear their thoughts then.”

“Correct, sir. But Esmeralda could.”

_“I did.”_

The Dealer smiled that same evil toothy smile, but it was without malice. In fact, it carried a deal of admiration. “I think the Rules are clear on this point,” he said.

#

By the time they had all had a big breakfast of _chilaquiles_, and gotten ready to go, the eastern sky was starting to show a faint smudge of morning’s gray light.

The Dealer had eaten happily, then left. Nobody had seen him leave; they just gradually realized that, after breakfast, they didn't see him around. Maria, shaking with her narrow escape and with weariness, had switched on the lights in the parking lot and come out, wrapping herself in a shawl. She had hugged Izzy about five times, and was clearly ready to do more. Mrs. E couldn’t blame her. The waitress was even happier when he sold her his disabled Suzuki for a dollar.

“Izzy,” Mrs. E said. “Anybody I should get in touch with?”

He smiled, a strange happy smile. “Nah. I’m good. Even engineers drop out sometimes.”

“Hey then. One thing: your first act as President should be to patch Fat Fuck.” He looked at her curiously. “He figured out how to… fixmycancer, OK, so I owe him, and he wants to be patched more than anything.”

“Cancer?”

“Hey, I see you stealing looks at your new bike. Go.” They shook hands, friends after everything, and he walked over to the amazing metallic chopper. Really a fucking work of art, almost dieselpunk. He turned the key in the ignition, stepped down on the starter, and the low rumbling lope was the sweetest thing…

Esmeralda, in an arch French-girl voice, said _“Whose motorcycle is zat?”_

“It’s a chopper, baby,” he replied.

_“Whose chopper is zat?”_

Izzy saw that Mrs. E was gaping at him. “What? Did you think I couldn’t talk with Esmeralda?”


She shook her head. “No. I figured sooner or later you would. It’s just… I can’t believe _you_ saw that movie.”

Izzy shook his head, looked at Maria. “Need a favor.”

“Anything.”

He gestured at the big black nightmare Triumphs the Black Riders had left behind. “Watch those for us. Put ‘em out of sight.”

“Here, Babe.” Roto fished something out of a pocket and threw it. Maria caught it and looked. A silver and turquoise bracelet. Looked like real Dineh work. “This’ll help you lie to the Black Riders without them knowing about it. If they’re fool enough to come back. Wear it whenever… hell. Wear it all the time.”

Izzy grinned, waved, blew Maria a kiss. The other Exclusives kicked their machines into life, building, bike by bike, a full-throated ragged roar. Then they rolled out in arcs across the parking lot with the kind of grace and power that the big bikes have, streaming away out into the burning dawn lifting up in the east.

Esmeralda had started humming that same wandering tune that she had brought into Sharon’s parking lot the night before. _Seems like a million years ago._

Mrs. E turned to Maria. “I’m sorry about all of this. Didn’t know I was bringing this kind of trouble. Will you be all right?”

The bartender shook her head, nodded, shrugged. Her dark gray hair stirred in the rising morning breeze. “Just… come back and see me, sometimes. OK? I want to talk to you. Be sure I’m not crazy.”

Mrs. E nodded. “I can do that. But I’ve got to go now. New body, new places I can go.”

“You know what _is_ crazy? I wish… There's a part of me that… well, I would have liked to join the Exclusives. I just couldn't.”

Mrs. E smiled. “Shotgun Maria. Of course there is, and of course you couldn't.” She lit a cigarette, and one for Maria. “You watch yourself though. This shit gives you cancer.”

When Esmeralda started, she made a rough stylish sound so much more interesting than the smooth throb of Izzy’s new machine. The odd little song she had been humming grew louder.

Mrs. E and her motorcycle rode into the Arizona morning. _Where are we going?_

_“You know.”_

_Yes. Rooooadsss._

Esmeralda chuckled, the happy sound of a girl without a care in the world, and a new rhythm wove into the beat of the Panhead engine. Then she began to sing the song she’d been humming.
