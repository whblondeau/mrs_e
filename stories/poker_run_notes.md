'So... is my bike going to start talking too?'

_"No,"_ said Esmeralda in a sad ghost of a whisper. _"That&apos;s not how your Potential looks, and... seriously, Dude. A crotch rocket? I mean really, a-"_ 

_Esmeralda, let it be._ "No, Izzy. Everybody's Potential is different." She took another drag, watched the smoke curl and plume. No visions there, at the moment. "Esmeralda and I had years together, and we spent a lot of time existing, neither of us clearly aware of the other-"

_"Speak for yourself, bitch."_
 
_Not now dammit._ "-Before I really started to wake up. And it's pretty significant that Esmeralda went through the initiation before I did... But really, there's something else here. You and I think in different ways." She shrugged. "It&apos;s not just the shape of our Potential. I live in language and story. You're an engineer. Your world is just so different from mine; I don't think you could really believe in having a verbal conversation with your motorcycle. No more than I could solve a partial differential equation. Whatever the fuck that might happen to be."

"You could learn. Most anybody can learn math." The confidence of the successful teacher rang in his voice.Briefly, she warmed to him.

Mrs. E smiled wryly. "Probably. With an enormous amount of effort." She felt the onset of vertigo that usually bothered her when she thought about this.

Mrs. E threw him the keys. He walked over to the chopper, and put a hand on the handlebars. She saw his stance change and soften, and he turned his head a little to the side. He had the look of someone listening for a faint sound from far off. Then he turned the key in the ignition and put a foot on the kickstarter. 

"Watch for kickback," Mrs. E warned. He grinned briefly, adjusted the choke, and stepped down with a smoothpush. And the bike started, with a sweet low rumble, a song of the long road. No tricks, no kickback.

He was about as tall as Zed had been. He swung a leg over the saddle, easily evading the sissy bar. He settled in, feet flat on the pavement to either side. The ape-hangers were weird to him, she could tell; and then, a moment later, he was relaxing into it, hands reaching up. Now that he was not hunching over the clip handlebars of the crotch rocket, he seemed to expand into himself for the first time. 

Esmeralda, in a girly French accent, said _"Whose motorcycle is zat?"_

Izzy grinned a bit, hesitated, then grinned wider. "It's a chopper, baby."

Mrs. E gaped.

"What?" said Izzy. "You didn&apos;t think I was learning to hear Esmeralda?"

"It&apos;s not that. You&apos;ve got lots of Potential, and I&apos;d be surprised if you didn&apos;t, sooner or later. It&apos;s just that I would never have guessed you would ever have seen that movie."

_"Guess I'm gonna have to watch my mouth."_
