###Route 66 Poker Run

####The Big T

Dry country sounds different than most places where people go. Especially on hot days; and, well, this was New Mexico in summertime. There&apos;s a kind of sound in the air: the sound of small stirrings of wind, the sound of redbrown rock and dirt baking in the daytime sun. Not really a sound you can hear; more of a background noise floor, a small pressure on the ear, with a big hot silence looming over it, empty and still. Only the occasional tick or ping from the cooling motorcycles broke it, and the creak from Izzy&apos;s leathers as he shifted. Boy didn&apos;t know how to hold still, but she didn&apos;t blame him much. It was just damned hot.

Not the hottest part of the state—_that would be down near Alamogordo,_ Mrs. E reckoned—but the Tucumcari area is always hot enough in summertime. It can go weeks without rain in a bad year, and this was a bad year. The dryland plants were shrinking down and thinning out, hunkering patiently against the age-old cycle. As the plants dwindled, the bones of the mountain were showing through.
Tucumcari Mountain isn’t really a mountain. It’s more of a two-mesa layer cake. They were up on the top of the lower mesa, north of of the upper mesa, and the air was a little cooler there; but they didn’t have any shade.

_Near the Big T_ had been the rendezvous description, and Tucumcari Mountain’s Big T wasn’t too far away. It looked like a scatter of weird white rocks, this close to, but from the distance it resolved into the hillside letter “T” that Tucumcari’s civic pride kept whitewashed. The local kids did it, apparently, had been doing that for years. It was a powerful ritual.

Overhead the sky was a darker kind of blue than Mrs. E was accustomed to seeing. She spotted a couple of buzzards up there, pretty high up. _Not looking for us, not yet,_ she thought with a smirk.

The silence was starting to get to her, so she dug out her pack of American Spirits, put one in her mouth, and sparked the Ronson. The startling rasp of the flint echoed out into the still heat like a mattock sinking through soil and hitting a rock. She drew in a grateful lungful, let it drift away in the surreptitiously moving air.

"That&apos;s gonna help."

"Yeah, Izzy, I believe it will." She took another contented drag.

"I told you, my name&apos;s Isaiah."

"And I told you not to be a whiny little bitch about my smoking, so I guess we&apos;re even." It wasn&apos;t her first time babysitting a greenhorn on a Route 66 run, but Izzy was particularly annoying. Well, somebody had to keep him alive.

Mrs. E took a long drink from her canteen, sloshed it. A little less than half full. "How&apos;s your water supply?" Izzy wore racing leathers and a full-coverage helmet, and he probably wasn&apos;t going to be careful about dehydration.

"I&apos;ve still got some Gatorade." Mrs. E made a face but didn&apos;t say anything. He had a point, and she was glad he was taking the dry country seriously enough in that respect. The power of suggestion worked, too: He pulled the bottle out and looked at it, then took a long swallow. "How much longer are we going to stand here in the g—in the damn sun?"

“We made good time. The dealer probably won’t make it for another hour or so. Still, the sooner we’re out of here the better.” The American Spirit was really a pleasure.

“Look… I know I’m not supposed to say anything, but smoking is really bad for you.”

She gave him a flat look. “Your point here?”

“Those things are going to kill you. Unless you crash and that do-rag somehow fails to protect your skull from impact.”

Mrs. E laughed. In her head, Esmeralda laughed too, a creaking sort of whispery laugh. _My motorcycle is weird,_ Mrs. E thought.

_“You wouldn’t ride me if I wasn’t.”_

_Weren’t_. Once an English teacher, always an English teacher.

“Izzy, you don’t get it. I might die soon, yes. Maybe on this trip; maybe you’ll have to deal with my dead body. But seriously, it’s my life… besides, I care more about keeping you from dying.” _You earnest, pious fuckwit._ 

“Well, if you die, you won’t exactly be able to even do that much, will you?” 

“Touché. But try not to worry about it. I’ve been riding for a long time, and Esmeralda won’t crash.” She dropped the butt and mashed it beneath her boot.

Izzy shook his head, scratching his nails through his brown curls where the sweat was itching. His full-coverage helmet wasn’t exactly comfortable in hot country. Mrs. E wore a do-rag for lots of reasons, not the least of which was a stubborn sense of personal style; but it sure felt better than any helmet she’d ever tried on. Especially in the heat. “Sometimes I think you think that she’s—it’s—a horse, not a motorcycle,” he said. “And then sometimes I think you just have an imaginary friend.”

_“If you only knew, kid,”_ said Esmeralda in her laryngitis-girl voice.

Izzy looked at their bikes. The machines could hardly have been more different. He rode a Suzuki GSXR 600 crotch rocket that exasperated Mrs. E: a hunched high-tension monster, weird-ass science fiction special effects styling including an obnoxious burnt-orange tank and fairing; to her, the thing hardly looked like a motorcycle at all. 

Esmeralda, by contrast, was a bobbed 1949 Harley Panhead, painted black everywhere: low-slung, spare, rakish. Rebuilt to be violently fast for a Harley, there was still no way that she could have gone nearly as fast as Izzy’s bike. But she had style to spare.

Back in the beginning, when Izzy, chafing in dumb testosterone resentment over his junior role in the Poker Run, had unwound on the freeway in Illinois, he had been shocked to see Mrs. E keeping up with him without apparent effort. She had let him run for a while, then signaled a slowdown when Esmeralda had expressed a little concern over the Suzuki’s ability to run redlined for so long. He had obeyed the signal (probably also worried about what the high-speed run was doing to his bike), and they had had a long cooldown run. 

Whey they’d finally stopped for a break, Izzy had refused to look at Mrs. E for a long time. Then he’d only said, “I don’t know what you had done to that bike. That just shouldn&apos;t be physically possible.” 

“More things than are dreamt of in your mechanical engineering,” was all she’d said.

That was the beginning of Izzy’s rough education in the realities of the Poker Run community. He had shown distinct signs of strain, especially when they’d gotten their third card, a Jack of Clubs, in Meramec caverns. The dealer was something in the dark that was undeniably not human. Mrs. E had kept a close eye on Izzy for a while after that: she had known too many non-D&D-playing engineers to be confident of his mental resilience. But he’d gotten over it, or at least decided to live with it provisionally. She thought he might do all right after all. With careful minding.

Now they were at the cryptically-designated Big T, waiting on a dealer—_story of my life_—with a middling hand: three Tens, Ace of Hearts, Six of Spades. This would be another discard deal, and they had to make it count. Three of a kind is pretty good in normal poker, but Route 66 Poker Run rules allowed as many discard-and-draw deals as the team could make within the time limit. They still had till sundown in two days; but it would be hard to get to many more dealers and still get to Santa Barbara by then. 

Then, too, she was tired, and Izzy was tired. Mrs. E thought that some of the other teams didn’t need much sleep.


It was not quite an hour later when they spotted the pickup truck. Green, somewhat rusty, working its way up to the Mountain.

“Think that’s him?” said Izzy.

“Unless it&apos;s someone who’s going to bust us for trespassing.” Mrs. E really didn’t think it would be that. She was good at sensing cops and patrols, and Esmeralda was better. Still, she kept wanting to stick a needle in Izzy. He was getting better. He didn’t tense up. Much.

They needn&apos;t have worried. It wasn’t any sort of law. To all appearances fully human and, to Mrs. E’s satisfaction, female. A sort of Western cowgirl archetype, in denim pearl-buttoned shirt and worn jeans and even more worn boots and an ancient stained cowboy hat. Masses of dark hair, tanned skin with maybe some Native blood, crow&apos;s feet at the corners of her eyes. “You the folks wanting a Dealer?”

“We are,” said Mrs. E. “Glad you could make it.”

“Sorry about the wait. I had to drive up here from Tucson.”

Esmeralda cackled and started singing in her dry whispery voice,

 > _“I&apos;ve been warped by the rain_
 
 > _Driven by the snow_
 
 > _I&apos;m drunk and dirty, don&apos;t you know…”_

_Knock it off, Esmeralda._ “Not a problem. Need a drink?”

The Dealer shook her head. “Plenty in the truck, thanks.”

“Then we won’t keep you. Izzy’s got the deck.”

He handed their deck to the Dealer. She opened the box (which neither of them could do) and looked at Mrs. E, who was looking at their hand in fierce concentration.

“Gimme two.” She handed the Ace and Six to the Dealer, who pocketed them, and who then dealt fairly off of the top. She closed the box and returned it to Izzy. 

“I&apos;ll be along then. Good luck.” With a friendly wave, the Dealer climbed into her pickup, circled, and jolted off down the Mountain.
“How are we doing,” asked Izzy when his eyes had stopped following the woman.

“Haven&apos;t looked yet,” said Mrs. E quietly. Izzy moved closer, stood next to her.

The cards up: Ten of Spades, Ten of Diamonds, Ten of Hearts. She turned the first dealt card: Three of Diamonds. Not good. She turned the second dealt card.

Ten of Clubs.

“...Well now,” said Mrs. E. “I think I’m going to buy you dinner.”

“Hope it’s close by.”

“We’re going to Del’s. It&apos;s in town, another 66 landmark. And don’t even fucking tell me that you don&apos;t like Mexican food.”
