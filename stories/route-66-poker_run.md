###Route 66 Poker Run

####The Big T

Dry country sounds different than most places where people go. Especially on hot days; and, well, this was New Mexico in summertime. There&apos;s a kind of sound in the air: the sound of small stirrings of wind, the sound of redbrown rock and dirt baking in the daytime sun. Not really a sound you can hear; more of a background noise floor, a small pressure on the ear, with a big hot silence looming over it, empty and still. Only the occasional tick or ping from the cooling motorcycles broke it, and the creak from Izzy&apos;s leathers as he shifted. Boy didn&apos;t know how to hold still, but she didn&apos;t blame him much. It was just damned hot.

Not the hottest part of the state—_that would be down near Alamogordo,_ Mrs. E reckoned—but the Tucumcari area is always hot enough in summertime. It can go weeks without rain in a bad year, and this was a bad year. The dryland plants were shrinking down and thinning out, hunkering patiently against the age-old cycle. As the plants dwindled, the bones of the mountain were showing through.
Tucumcari Mountain isn’t really a mountain. It’s more of a two-mesa layer cake. They were up on the top of the lower mesa, north of of the upper mesa, and the air was a little cooler there; but they didn’t have any shade.

_Near the Big T_ had been the rendezvous description, and Tucumcari Mountain’s Big T wasn’t too far away. It looked like a scatter of weird white rocks, this close to, but from the distance it resolved into the hillside letter “T” that Tucumcari’s civic pride kept whitewashed. The local kids did it, apparently, had been doing that for years. It was a powerful ritual.

Overhead the sky was a darker kind of blue than Mrs. E was accustomed to seeing. She spotted a couple of buzzards up there, pretty high up. _Not looking for us, not yet,_ she thought with a smirk.

The silence was starting to get to her, so she dug out her pack of American Spirits, put one in her mouth, and sparked the Ronson. The startling rasp of the flint echoed out into the still heat like a mattock sinking through soil and hitting a rock. She drew in a grateful lungful, let it drift away in the surreptitiously moving air.

"That&apos;s gonna help."

"Yeah, Izzy, I believe it will." She took another contented drag.

"I told you, my name&apos;s Isaiah."

"And I told you not to be a whiny little bitch about my smoking, so I guess we&apos;re even." It wasn&apos;t her first time babysitting a greenhorn on a Route 66 run, but Izzy was particularly annoying. Well, somebody had to keep him alive.

Mrs. E took a long drink from her canteen, sloshed it. A little less than half full. "How&apos;s your water supply?" Izzy wore racing leathers and a full-coverage helmet, and he probably wasn&apos;t going to be careful about dehydration.

"I&apos;ve still got some Gatorade." Mrs. E made a face but didn&apos;t say anything. He had a point, and she was glad he was taking the dry country seriously enough in that respect. The power of suggestion worked, too: He pulled the bottle out and looked at it, then took a long swallow. "How much longer are we going to stand here in the g—in the damn sun?"

“We made good time. The dealer probably won’t make it for another hour or so. Still, the sooner we’re out of here the better.” The American Spirit was really a pleasure.

“Look… I know I’m not supposed to say anything, but smoking is really bad for you.”

She gave him a flat look. “Your point here?”

“Those things are going to kill you. Unless you crash and that do-rag somehow fails to protect your skull from impact.”

Mrs. E laughed. In her head, Esmeralda laughed too, a creaking sort of whispery laugh. _My motorcycle is weird,_ Mrs. E thought.

_“You wouldn’t ride me if I wasn’t.”_

_Weren’t_. Once an English teacher, always an English teacher.

“Izzy, you don’t get it. I might die soon, yes. Maybe on this trip; maybe you’ll have to deal with my dead body. But seriously, it’s my life… besides, I care more about keeping _you_ from dying.” _You earnest, pious fuckwit._ 

“Well, if you die, you won’t exactly be able to even do that much, will you?” 

“Touché. But try not to worry about it. I’ve been riding for a long time, and Esmeralda won’t crash.” She dropped the butt and mashed it beneath her boot.

Izzy shook his head, scratching his nails through his brown curls where the sweat was itching. His full-coverage helmet wasn’t exactly comfortable in hot country. Mrs. E wore a do-rag for lots of reasons, not the least of which was a stubborn sense of personal style; but it sure felt better than any helmet she’d ever tried on. Especially in the heat. “Sometimes I think you think that she’s—it’s—a horse, not a motorcycle,” he said. “And then sometimes I think you just have an imaginary friend.”

_“If you only knew, kid,”_ said Esmeralda in her laryngitis-girl voice.

Izzy looked at their bikes. The machines could hardly have been more different. He rode a Suzuki GSXR 600 crotch rocket that exasperated Mrs. E: a hunched high-tension monster, weird-ass science fiction special effects styling including an obnoxious burnt-orange tank and fairing; to her, the thing hardly looked like a motorcycle at all. 

Esmeralda, by contrast, was a bobbed 1949 Harley Panhead, painted black everywhere: low-slung, spare, rakish. Rebuilt to be violently fast for a Harley, there was still no way that she could have gone nearly as fast as Izzy’s bike. But she had style to spare.

Back in the beginning, when Izzy, chafing in dumb testosterone resentment over his junior role in the Poker Run, had unwound on the freeway in Illinois, he had been shocked to see Mrs. E keeping up with him without apparent effort. She had let him run for a while, then signaled a slowdown when Esmeralda had expressed a little concern over the Suzuki’s ability to run redlined for so long. He had obeyed the signal (probably also worried about what the high-speed run was doing to his bike), and they had had a long cooldown run. 

Whey they’d finally stopped for a break, Izzy had refused to look at Mrs. E for a long time. Then he’d only said, “I don’t know what you had done to that bike. That just shouldn&apos;t be physically possible.” 

“More things than are dreamt of in your mechanical engineering,” was all she’d said.

That was the beginning of Izzy’s rough education in the realities of the Poker Run community. He had shown distinct signs of strain, especially when they’d gotten their third card, a Jack of Clubs, in Meramec caverns. The Dealer was something in the dark that was undeniably not human. Mrs. E had kept a close eye on Izzy for a while after that: she had known too many non-D&D-playing engineers to be confident of his mental resilience. But he’d gotten over it, or at least decided to live with it provisionally. She thought he might do all right after all. With careful minding.

Now they were at the cryptically-designated Big T, waiting on a Dealer—_story of my life_—with a middling hand: three Tens, Ace of Hearts, Six of Spades. This would be another discard deal, and they had to make it count. Three of a kind is pretty good in normal poker, but Route 66 Poker Run rules allowed as many discard-and-draw deals as the team could make within the time limit. They still had till sundown in two days; but it would be hard to get to many more Dealers and still get to Santa Barbara by then. 

Then, too, she was tired, and Izzy was tired. Mrs. E thought that some of the other teams didn’t need much sleep.


It was not quite an hour later when they spotted the pickup truck. Green, somewhat rusty, working its way up to the Mountain.

“Think that’s him?” said Izzy.

“Unless it&apos;s someone who’s going to bust us for trespassing.” Mrs. E really didn’t think it would be that. She was good at sensing cops and patrols, and Esmeralda was better. Still, she kept wanting to stick a needle in Izzy. He was getting better. He didn’t tense up. Much.

They needn&apos;t have worried. It wasn’t any sort of law. To all appearances fully human and, to Mrs. E’s satisfaction, female. A sort of Western cowgirl archetype, in denim pearl-buttoned shirt and worn jeans and even more worn boots and an ancient stained cowboy hat. Masses of dark hair, tanned skin with maybe some Native blood, crow&apos;s feet at the corners of her eyes. “You the folks wanting a Dealer?”

“We are,” said Mrs. E. “Glad you could make it.”

“Sorry about the wait. I had to drive up here from Tucson.”

Esmeralda cackled and started singing in her dry whispery voice,

 > _“I&apos;ve been warped by the rain_
 
 > _Driven by the snow_
 
 > _I&apos;m drunk and dirty, don&apos;t you know…”_

_Knock it off, Esmeralda._ “Not a problem. Need a drink?”

The Dealer shook her head. “Plenty in the truck, thanks.”

“Then we won’t keep you. Izzy’s got the deck.”

He handed their deck to the Dealer. She opened the box (which neither of them could do) and looked at Mrs. E, who was looking at their hand in fierce concentration.

“Gimme two.” She handed the Ace and Six to the Dealer, who pocketed them, and who then dealt fairly off of the top. She closed the box and returned it to Izzy. 

“I&apos;ll be along then. Good luck.” With a friendly wave, the Dealer climbed into her pickup, circled, and jolted off down the Mountain.
“How are we doing,” asked Izzy when his eyes had stopped following the woman.

“Haven&apos;t looked yet,” said Mrs. E quietly. Izzy moved closer, stood next to her.

The cards up: Ten of Spades, Ten of Diamonds, Ten of Hearts. She turned the first dealt card: Three of Diamonds. Not good. She turned the second dealt card.

Ten of Clubs.

“...Well now,” said Mrs. E. “I think I’m going to buy you dinner.”

“Hope it’s close by.”

“We’re going to Del’s. It&apos;s in town, another 66 landmark. And don’t even fucking tell me that you don&apos;t like Mexican food.” 


#### Roadhouse

Immense cirrus brooms swept the sunset west, burning, pierced with contrails, looking like God was a redhead and She had shoved chopsticks in Her hair, the messy way that certain redheads can get away with, and if you say anything they just unbutton a top button and look at you some more. The roadhouse up ahead under that ragged display of sky had to be the place: Sharon’s Bar and Grill.
 
The clue had been “Don’t keep the Deal to yourself.” Mrs E snorted. Sometimes the Route 66 Poker Run community was overly cute.

Anyway, they needed food and a rest, and it was getting time to gas up the bikes. The Deal in Flagstaff had lost them a lot of time, and hadn’t paid off all that well: they’d upgraded their kicker card from three of diamonds to six of hearts. Now they really should push on. Mrs. E hoped that the Dealer at Sharon’s would not be hard to find, and wouldn’t make them wait.

They motored into the dirt and gravel parking lot and eased themselves off of the bikes. Esmeralda was quietly humming a little wandering song that Mrs. E couldn’t place.
 
Sharon’s was a pretty typical Western place: a low frame pole building, not a lot of neon, lamplight shining out of the windows over the railed front walk in the darkening evening. A few pickups and 4-wheelers in the parking lot, a smattering of other vehicles. Not exactly a jumping night.

They pushed through the doors. “Table?” asked Izzy.

“Ordinarily. But tonight I want to sit where we can talk to those underutilized bartenders.”

They hoisted their road-weary asses onto barstools. Izzy was carrying his helmet, which she thought was kind of dumb, but at least it helped identify them. Not very many of the customers scattered round the tables bothered to look at them much.

The bartender, a lean kindly-faced woman with a fall of iron-gray hair, ambled down to their end of the bar. “Evenin’. Can I get you folks anything?”

“Got anything from Pearl Street Brewery?” asked Izzy.

The bartender smiled a bit. “They don’t deliver down here, as it happens.”

“Uh, OK… what was that brewery in Flagstaff?”

The bartender wasn’t busy, and she seemed to enjoy rambling conversations about breweries, so Mrs. E let it ride without trying to bust things up. Eventually Izzy settled on a nut brown ale that the bartender thought he’d like. “And you?”

Mrs. E smiled a little. “Lone Star. And a big glass of water. We’ve been on the bikes all day. And menus.” The bartender dropped a small wink and moved off.

“So,” Izzy said, “How many more Deals can we make before we need to get to the end?”

Mrs. E had been thinking about it. “Maybe two more, if this one doesn’t slow us down as much as the last one did.”

“Is it really that important? We’ve got four of a kind already.”

“Which is pretty good, in a normal game of poker. But we’re playing against some tough customers who move fast. And the kicker card matters…”

“…because everybody’s got their own deck.” He grinned. Nice grin. Kid wasn’t exactly handsome, but he could crinkle the corners of his eyes just as if he were. “I’m not as dumb as I come off.”

Their drinks came. The bartender, taking the hint, had brought Izzy a water unasked. Mrs. E took a long swallow. The Lone Star was crackling cold and it felt wonderful going down her throat. “Ah hell, I needed that.”

The bartender grinned. “So, what brings you through these parts?”

“Honeymoon,” Mrs E deadpanned. Izzy choked on his beer, and the bartender smirked appreciatively. “No, it’s a little less likely than that.”

“Poker Run, huh?”

Mrs. E stared at the woman for just a moment, mind blank. “I’m Mrs. E. And this is Izzy.”

“Isaiah.”

“Maria.” She shook his extended hand.

“You know about the Poker Runs, do you?” asked Mrs. E.

“Sure. They’ve been through here time and again. Route 66.” She skipped a deliberate beat. “People with a lot of Potential.” She nodded at Izzy. “Like him. And sometimes the ones you can’t place. Like you.”
Izzy was gaping. Mrs. E felt like doing the same thing, but she had her, well, poker face on.

Potential was something she had known how to recognize for a long time. Thing was, Maria clearly had no trace of it. She could be a lifelong orienteer with a Vincent Black Shadow parked in front of her house, who worked the Times of London crossword every day, and the Poker Run Committee wouldn’t give her the time of day.

She wouldn’t even be able to find the Committee to talk to them. Even Izzy had managed to do that himself, without help.

So how had she—

Suddenly there was a growing roll of thunder from outside. Not a storm of the air, but a storm of engines. Mrs. E knew it instantly. Big cruiser motorcycles were rumbling into Sharon’s parking lot, and stopping. She counted them off as they shut off.

Esmeralda’s voice, thinned to a distant whisper, reached her mental hearing. Just barely. _“This isn’t good, Honey, not good at all…”_

Izzy was blinking and frowning uneasily. “What are—”

Mrs. E held up a finger, wait. Seven, eight—nine?… “Nine or ten bikes. And take it from me, these are not your basic Minnesota Shriners on Gold Wings.” She looked flatly at Maria. “Might be trouble. Do you get outlaws in here much?”

Maria twisted her mouth sideways a bit. “Some. Never had much of a problem with ‘em. They’re not as bad as people say, long as you give ‘em some respect.”

Mrs. E nodded. “I always got along with the Diablos pretty well, and I wouldn’t expect trouble with the Angels…”

“Oh shit - _Hell’s_ Angels? That’s what you mean by ‘outlaw’?”

“Yeah, Izzy, but the HA’s aren’t usually a problem, not for civilians anyway. They just don’t have much to prove. There are other clubs though, and some of them… Some of them, especially the associate clubs, have a lot to prove. Like Republican politicians or guys with tiny dicks who buy big trucks. Gotta be more extreme to get noticed.

“And sometimes people are just fucking evil, and there are clubs where lots of evil assholes coagulate.” She sighed. “But one thing I can tell you about just about every outlaw club on the planet?

“They’re gonna seriously disrespect a Suzuki crotch rocket.”

Izzy turned pale and sat for a moment, then stood up reluctantly. Mrs. E stood up too. “Besides, Esmeralda’s not happy. I needed a smoke anyway. Let’s go see what they’re up to. Hopefully having a smoke themselves.”

“Who’s Esmeralda?” Maria wanted to know.

“Tell you later. We’ll be back in to order dinner.”


<br/>
The bikers outside were having a smoke, yes. But they were not normal outlaws. Nothing even close.

The bikes were almost reasonable, but they weren’t at all the kind of thing an outlaw club would ride. Intensely stylish machines, not Harleys or any model she really knew. Each one customized to a sort of restrained gothic look: heavy fantasies in black and chrome, huge square engines with radiators on the front. She’d never seen anything tricked out to look so convincingly vampiric; most goth bikes ended up looking like they were designed by eighth-grade stoners, but these were solid, brutal, organic bikes with lines that breathed speed. Like Ed Roth had risen from the grave and turned his hand to designing bikes for a Halloween rally.

The riders, though, the riders were just fucking strange.

First of all, they had helmets, which outlaws never use. Black, rakish helmets, with visors that jutted down shadowing their faces. Some of them had left the helmets with the big bikes; but they were all wearing black hoodies, and the ones who had taken their helmets off had flipped the hoods up over their heads, shadowing their faces almost like medieval monks. The effect was spooky and menacing, not monastic.

_“Religious orders are spooky and menacing too, dear.”_

Mrs. E looked for the club insignia. Every outlaw club wears a sleeveless vest over everything else, the “colors”, with conventional artwork and legends proudly sewn or embroidered on the back. These bikers had vests of black denim all right, but the insignia was unusually simplistic: a single stylized red eye, glaring. She looked back at the bikes and saw a similar device on the side of every gas tank.

_You have got to be fucking kidding me._ Black mounts, Black garb, shadowed faces… and the Red Eye.

Nine Riders.

Which wasn’t as silly as might have been the case if they were just ordinary geeks on bikes. They were not. Each of the Riders she focused her attention on had Potential. As much as Izzy, some of them. And perhaps the most frightening thing was that they were adapting themes right out of Tolkien—nothing from Peter Jackson’s stupid movies. That kind of discipline and thinking meant they were dangerous: channeling Potential depended on powerful, intelligent use of the deep imagination.

_“Yeah, that’s what they are, all right,”_ said Esmeralda, sounding shaken. _“What… Are they trying to do the Poker Run?”_

“Tough customers who move fast, and cheat,” Mrs. E said grimly. “These are not Poker Run players,” she continued for both Izzy and Esmeralda’s benefit. “These Nazgûl, these Black Riders, are henchmen. Somebody sent them.”

“Why are they here?” Izzy was speaking with quiet attention.

“They might be here to take us out,” said Mrs. E. “Poker Run’s a dangerous business. People have killed to eliminate players with strong hands before, although it’s damned difficult to know who’s got what. Still, like any card game, there’s usually some way to cheat… But they don’t even have to kill us. Just damage the bikes. If they start making a move in that direction, I’m intervening.”

“How can you do that?” asked Izzy reasonably. “There are nine of them; they’ve got Potential set up to fulfill one of the more frightening archetypes of modern literature.”

“We’re armed,” she reminded him. Or did you…”

“Yeah. My Glock is with the bike.”

Mrs. E was silent for a moment. “Don’t ever do that again.”

“I won’t.”

“Well… I’ve got six bullets in my revolver. That’s a few short even if I shoot better than I’ve ever done in my life. And it’s hard to shoot well when Potential’s working against you. And I have to admit, I don’t want to kill anybody, even someone who might want to kill me.”

“‘Might?’”

“Yeah, ‘might’. Maybe they’re not here to kill us at all.”

_“Fuck else would they be here for?”_ Esmeralda whispered, sounding miserable.

“Maybe they want to kill the Dealer.”

“It’s kind of discouraging when you say things like that,” said Izzy after a moment. “All right. I don’t know much about Potential except that I have a lot of it. Can I—”

_“Nono don’t.”_

“Esmeralda says No. I say Not only No, but Fuck No. It’s not just that they’d kill you. They could probably control your Potential and use it against us… Look, right now getting that Glock is the biggest thing we need to worry about. Esmeralda, can you tell if the Nazgûl are armed?”

_“...Knives, but no guns or grenades or anything,”_ she said after a minute.

“Esmeralda says no guns. Knives only. So here’s what we do. I will go and engage them, get their attention. You time it as best you can, walk—<i>walk</i>, you hear me? Don’t hustle, be cool—over to your bike, unlock the side panel, get your gun. Make sure it’s loaded and the safety is off. The safety is _off_, all right?”

“I’m an engineer. I get that.”

“You’re an engineer who left his fucking gun in the lockup on his bike. You don’t have a combat-type mind. Violence starts, you try to keep your shit together, be methodical, and don’t shoot anybody except the Nazgul. Don’t wait, just start. One at a time. Don’t shoot fast; take time to fucking aim. One. At. A. Time.” Mrs. E realized that she was terrified, which always made her repeat herself; but that was probably right for Izzy. Anyway, she seemed to be in control of herself. “Fucking Poker Runs, why do I even do this shit? More backstabbing than a Faculty Committee.”

_Esmeralda, tell me if something starts to happen._

“All right, Izzy. Showtime. And? If something happens to your bike, get Esmeralda the fuck out of here.”

_“Not without you! I won’t start!”_

_I need you to get the fuck out if something goes wrong. Do it for me, Esmeralda, if it’s got to be done, just please do it._

Mrs. E fished an American Spirit out of her pocket, and walked over to where the Black Riders were smoking. Somebody, she figured, ought to have a light.
