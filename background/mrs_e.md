San Francisco, January 1965 - November 1967

Departed San Francisco on a Norton 650 and roamed over the western part of the United States, Canada and Mexico. Places and dates are not altogether certain, due to her unmoored state of mind and her relentless mobility. A self-described "bisexual hippie chick with a big motorcycle", she found herself often forced to travel unexpectedly.

Married Roy William Emory, 1970. A luthier and physicist. They stayed together for 3 years, then parted - still much in love emotionally, but intellectually incompatible - when he decided that the counterculture was a failure. They quarreled like worms on a hook, but eventually broke up in Algoma, Wisconsin in August of 1973.
